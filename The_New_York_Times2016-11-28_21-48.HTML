</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The grandson of an immigrant, Mr. Trump now slanders immigrants. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't have a lot to add to the story of Donald Trump, his slander against Mexican immigrants and the ensuing self-induced immolation of his media empire, except to note that what we have here is a classic American immigrant story.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tale of first- and second-generation strivers using their gumption and grit to give their descendants the opportunity to dream big and become whatever they choose in America - even candidates for president, maybe, or embarrassing publicity-hungry blowhards, an affront to everything their ancestors stood for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, in Donald Trump's case, all those things at once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father, Fred Trump, was a developer who built tens of thousands of affordable apartments in the 1950s and 60s for the working-class residents of Brooklyn and Queens. He was known for sober management, thriftiness and humble dedication to his work. When he died in 1999, age 93, his obituary in The Times noted that he mixed his own floor-cleaning chemicals. Fred's father was a German immigrant - Friedrich Drumpf - who was an innkeeper in the Yukon gold rush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow their seed sprouted into Donald Trump, crash-and-burn casino mogul, perennial bankruptcy-emerger, media monstrosity and now Republican candidate for president, running for president to protect America from a Mexican-border flood of drug smugglers and rapists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those words are his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Mexicans are returning the insult, buying Donald Trump pi&ntilde;atas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Trump has doubled down on his racist slanders against hypothetical rapists, some readers may remember his strange defense of an actual rapist, his old friend Mike Tyson. In 1992 Mr. Trump urged prosecutors in Indiana, where Mr. Tyson had been charged with raping a beauty-pageant contestant, to let him buy his way out of prison for a few million dollars. The offer was declined; Mr. Tyson was convicted and sentenced to six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems fair at this point - even essential - to note that Mr. Trump is far from alone as an immigrant-hostile Republican running for president. The dominating message from the ever-widening field of G.O.P. candidates is that what the country needs most, now, is to lock down the border and overturn President Obama's executive actions on immigration reform. Listening to Republicans talk on this subject is like being stuck in a bar with the same cruddy cover band that never, ever learns a new song. I wonder how long they will let Mr. Trump remain out front, screaming his head off.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">585 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. Bush cited Mr. Obama&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;rhetoric of divisiveness,&amp;#8221; but the president&amp;#8217;s comments are only divisive if you refuse to recognize the facts. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be obvious by now that Republican candidates for public office are uneasy talking about race, ethnicity and gender. But even by that standard, Jeb Bush and Donald Trump plummeted to some pretty disturbing new lows this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, told an audience in Iowa on Tuesday that voters ought to forget about tiny little things like &quot;race and ethnicity and income.&quot; And he attacked two people who he said were trying to scare and divide Americans - Mr. Trump and, incredibly, President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are people that prey on people's fears and angst as well,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;Whether it's Donald Trump or Barack Obama, their rhetoric of divisiveness is wrong.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Give Mr. Bush his point about Donald Trump. His continuing racist rants about Mexico are offensive. His claim on &quot;Morning Joe&quot; today that Hispanics will vote for him because he employs a lot of them was beyond laughable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hispanics love me,&quot; Mr. Trump said at one point - a phrase that Charles Blow pointed out in an Op-Ed column in 2011 is the worst kind of phony racial pandering. Charles recalled Lauryn Hill's memorable line that &quot;men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But comparing Mr. Trump to Mr. Obama and claiming that the president has been trying to scare and divide Americans is simply disgraceful. Pointing out that there are still racial tensions, that black Americans suffer violence at the hands of the police and of civilian racists and are treated unjustly by the justice system is only divisive if you refuse to recognize those obvious facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telling the world, for example, that Trayvon Martin looked like the son he might have had was not an act of racial divisiveness on Mr. Obama's part - unless you reject the idea that an African American president is allowed to act like an African American president every now and then. White presidents don't get faulted for acting like white people, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was striking about Mr. Obama's appearance recently at the memorial service for the shooting victims in Charleston was that the United States finally has an African American president who could go to a place like that and credibly join in the mourning for eight people shot down by a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Mr. Bush managed to do by comparing President Obama to Donald Trump was to give voters another sign that he is out of touch with American reality, and has nothing terribly meaningful to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush also said: &quot;A Republican will never win by striking fear in people's hearts. A Republican can win and will win if we have&nbsp;an aspirational message that gives people hope that their lives will be better when we apply conservative principles the right way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was kind of hilarious, especially when you consider that Republicans have been running on fear for decades. His father's campaigns in 1988 and 1992 played shamelessly on societal, racial, religious and ethnic fears. George W. Bush called himself a &quot;uniter not a divider&quot; in the 2000 campaign, but also preyed on fear as a way of moving public opinion and votes. He waved the bloody shirt of the 9/11 attacks at every opportunity, especially in his re-election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't blame Jeb Bush for being very annoyed by the fact that Donald Trump is doing so well in the polls because of name recognition, huge press attention and the red meat he keeps throwing to the fringe, intolerant right. But he only hurts himself with the broad American electorate with the kind of nonsense he tossed around at that event in Iowa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump wants to rock in the free world, but Neil Young is not having it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump, the billionaire businessman, drew Mr. Young's rebuke on Tuesday when he strode across the stage at Trump Tower to declare his presidential candidacy backed by Mr. Young's song &quot;Rockin' in the Free World.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' in the Free World' in his presidential candidacy announcement,&quot; the musician's team said in a statement. &quot;Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for president of the United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Mr. Young would insult The Donald for using his rock anthem and endorse someone more liberal could have been foreseen. After all, the song is famously liberal, having been written as an indictment of the poverty policies of the elder President George Bush's administration. Mr. Trump is a Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not the first presidential candidate to be admonished for using an artist's song without permission. In April, Senator Marco Rubio declared his candidacy to the electronic tune &quot;Something New,&quot; drawing disapproval from the Swedish duo Axwell and Ingrosso. Mitt Romney was a three-time offender during his 2012 presidential campaign, drawing scorn for using K'naan's &quot;Wavin' Flag,&quot; the Silversun Pickups's &quot;Panic Switch,&quot; and Survivor's &quot;Eye of the Tiger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is Mr. Trump the first conservative to use music with a mismatched message. Ronald Reagan praised &nbsp;Bruce Springsteen's &quot;message of hope&quot; after The Boss released the album &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; The title song was written to protest broken government, the vast military-industrial complex and the mistreatment of American war veterans, but it has become a patriotic anthem, and politicians of all stripes continue rocking to it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Read the entire article and answer these questions, supporting your responses by citing evidence from the text. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. What comments did Donald Trump make about Mexican immigrants last month while announcing his candidacy to be America's next president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. How have some American and Mexican companies reacted to Mr. Trump's remarks?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. How have his comments seemed to have affected his polling in the Republican presidential primary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The article concludes with a quote from Ostensia Bonilla, who moved to Illinois in 2007 with her daughter, but decided to move back to Mexico after two years. She says: &quot;Of course, we do have drug problems. And Mr. Trump has a right to free speech. But we aren't the ones using the drugs, the addicts are in America.&quot; Why do you think the author decided to end the article this way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. What is your reaction to Mr. Trump's remarks? Do you agree with the companies like NBC and Macy's that are severing business ties with his companies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Going Further </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you been following the race for the presidency? Even though we're still over 15 months from the 2016 election, seemingly every week someone new announces his or her candidacy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many of the 14 Republicans who are running can you name? How many of the five Democrats can you name?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another high-profile chef has dropped out of Donald Trump's forthcoming luxury hotel in the historic Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington, D.C., after Mr. Trump's provocative statements about Mexican immigrants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef and a partner at the Lambs Club and other Manhattan restaurants, was to open a branch of the National, his brasserie-style restaurant in Midtown, in the new hotel. But on Thursday, he said in a written statement that ''the recent statements surrounding Mexican immigrants by Donald Trump do not in any way align with my personal core values.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zakarian's decision to abandon the project, scheduled to open in 2016, follows that of the chef Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s. Mr. Andr&eacute;s has said that Mr. Trump's statements made ''it impossible for my company and I to move forward.'' More than half of his team is Hispanic, as are many of his guests, the chef said. On Thursday, Mr. Zakarian said, ''Zakarian Hospitality employs many immigrants from nations all over the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Andr&eacute;s is a Spanish chef who became an American citizen in 2013. Mr. Zakarian and his parents were born in this country; his ancestors emigrated from Armenia and Poland about 100 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump said in a speech June 16 that some Mexican immigrants bring drugs and crime to the United States, and some are rapists. On Wednesday, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, called Mr. Trump and asked him to speak in more measured tones.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By PETER WEHNER. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the last three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump is a force in the Republican presidential race. Two recent polls show him running second to Jeb Bush nationally. He's also polling second in Iowa and New Hampshire. And his pronouncements are commanding attention, especially on Fox News, where he's a popular presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of this is attributable to the fact that Mr. Trump is a genius at drawing the spotlight to himself. He thrives on social media. Democrats and the press are only too happy to highlight Mr. Trump's stream of invective and outrageous utterances, including his claim that Mexico is purposely sending us drug dealers, rapists and carriers of infectious diseases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To their credit, several Republican presidential candidates, including Rick Perry, Marco Rubio and Mr. Bush, have criticized Mr. Trump. Yet it's also true that Mr. Trump has garnered respect from some of his fellow Republicans. According to Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump is ''bold,'' ''brash'' and ''speaks the truth.'' Rick Santorum likes it that he's focused on ''a very important issue for American workers and particularly, legal immigrants in this country.'' An editorial in The Weekly Standard says Republicans can benefit from ''a little touch of Trump'' in rhetoric, attitude and bearing. According to Rush Limbaugh, Mr. Trump's statements will ''resonate'' with many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They may. But they shouldn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For starters, Mr. Trump, though he claims to be a conservative, is nothing of the sort. He's barely even a Republican. For most of the last decade, he was a registered Democrat. It wasn't that long ago that most of his political contributions went to Democrats, including Senators Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Before he discovered his Republican roots, Mr. Trump favored a single-payer health care system and proposed a large ''net worth tax'' on wealthy individuals. He once declared himself ''strongly pro-choice'' and favored drug legalization. He is a vehement protectionist. Earlier this year he even accused Republicans running for president of ''attacking'' Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Why would conservatives find him the least bit appealing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump has no coherent governing philosophy. All he has is an attitude, and a crude one at that. As his announcement speech and subsequent statements have made clear, his command of the issues is superficial, his presentation often rambling and demagogic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the heart of Donald Trump's candidacy is folie de grandeur. Mr. Trump will build a fence on the southern border -- and get Mexico to pay for it. He's got a ''foolproof'' plan to defeat the Islamic State ''very quickly,'' but when asked what it is, he told Fox's Greta Van Susteren, ''I'm not gonna tell you what it is tonight.'' He'll have a ''great relationship'' with Vladimir V. Putin while also keeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. His policy views on China consist mostly of bluster (''Oh, would China be in trouble. The poor Chinese.''). Mr. Trump is eager to tell us that ''there's nobody bigger and better at the military than I am.'' He also gets things done ''better than anybody.'' And he will be ''the greatest jobs president that God ever created.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump thinks he'll snap his fingers and everyone from his political opponents to foreign nations will bend to his will. He is a man operating on his own fantasy island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's also the matter of Mr. Trump's erratic and conspiratorial temperament. He believes ''massive vaccinations'' cause autism (''the doctors lied''). He was the most prominent person in America pushing the theory that President Obama -- a ''psycho!'' and ''maybe'' a Muslim -- might not be a natural-born American citizen. And he delights in making malicious statements. He's absolutely sure, for example, that Mexicans crossing our southern border are drug dealers and rapists, but he can only ''assume'' there are ''some good people'' crossing the border as well. (Mr. Trump would later say that ''many fabulous people come in from Mexico'' and ''I get along great with Mexico. I get along great.'' Of course he does.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for political discourse, Mr. Trump is insulting and witless. His critics are ''losers,'' ''jerks'' and ''dummies.'' These kinds of taunts are usually found in schoolyards rather than presidential campaigns. But a presidential campaign is right where he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's not much that can be done about that. If conservatives rally to defend Mr. Trump on the grounds that he's ''refreshing'' and has ''passion,'' that he's ''anti-establishment'' and irritates liberals, they will do considerable damage to their movement and to the Republican Party. Mr. Trump is a pernicious figure on the American political landscape. He can't be wished away. Which means the people who have to confront and expose him are conservatives. We're the ones who have the most to lose from a successful Trump candidacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Speaking on CNN&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;State of the Union,&amp;#8221; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina sharply attacked Mr. Trump&amp;#8217;s caustic remarks on immigration and called on other candidates to speak out against him. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Scott Walker and the Obama administration's negotiations with Iran for a nuclear containment deal dominated the Sunday news shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump, the real-estate developer and reality-television star, wasn't a guest on any of the shows, but he was a major focus of conversation a day after he held a rally in Arizona and discussed border security and immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the rally, Mr. Trump, who is running for president as a Republican after years of flirting with a campaign,  invoked a phrase that was popular in the Nixon administration - &quot;silent majority&quot; -to describe who he is speaking for in his caustic comments and hard-line views on immigration. But on CNN's &quot;State of the Union,&quot; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, another Republican presidential candidate, sharply attacked Mr. Trump and his message and called on his party's chairman and other candidates to speak out against him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump is a &quot;wrecking ball&quot; for the GOP as it tries to appeal to Hispanic voters, Mr. Graham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To all the candidates who think that Donald Trump is telling the truth, I think you have lost your way.  As to the Republican Party, if we do not reject this way of thinking clearly, without any ambiguity, we will have lost our way,&quot; he said. &quot;We will have lost the moral authority, in my view, to govern this great nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Graham, who favors a comprehensive immigration reform bill, told host Dana Bash that it was &quot;incumbent upon the chairman&quot; of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, to speak out publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Republican candidate, Carly Fiorina, appearing on ABC News' &quot;This Week,&quot; defended Mr. Trump, saying that his name doesn't often come up as she campaigns but that he &quot;taps into an anger that I hear every day. People are angry that a commonsense thing like securing the border or ending sanctuary cities is somehow considered extreme. It's not extreme, it's commonsense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker of the House John Boehner, the Ohio Republican, demurred on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; when asked whether Mr. Trump is hurting the party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if he's helping or hurting,&quot; Mr. Boehner said. But he added, &quot;Other candidates out there have much more responsible positions, in my view.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He faulted President Obama for the current political environment in which passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill would be difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of a deal curtailing Iran's nuclear capabilities, which Mr. Obama is seeking as a signature foreign policy achievement in his second term,  Mitch McConnell, Mr. Boehner's Senate counterpart, said such an agreement will be &quot;a very hard sell, if it's completed, in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on &quot;Fox News Sunday,&quot; Mr. McConnell said the administration would have done better to &quot;ratchet up sanctions even farther because that's what brought&quot; Iran to the negotiating table to begin with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing on the show after Mr. McConnell, Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator and current Democratic presidential hopeful, demonstrated again why he is such an unusual fit in his party, as he joined in the criticism of an Iran deal and of Democrats for moving too far to the left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On CBS News'  &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; the presidential candidate who is seen by many  as most embodying that liberal shift, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, refused to criticize the Democratic leader in the polls, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like Hillary Clinton and I respect Hillary Clinton and I'm not going to engage in personal attacks against Hillary Clinton,&quot; Mr. Sanders said. But he added that on &quot;issue after issue&quot; there are &quot;very significant differences of opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as Mr. Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin, prepares to announce his presidential campaign on Monday, his two sons - who support gay marriage while he opposes it - appeared with Ms. Bash.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his nearly hourlong ceremony announcing his presidential candidacy on Tuesday, Donald Trump was typically bombastic, opinionated and full of praise for himself. The following are some of his best quotations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Immigration Policy and Mexico </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best - they're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Chinese Oligarchs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the U.S. Military Defending Saudi Arabia </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Other Presidential Candidates, and Lobbyists </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors and by the special interests - fully. They control them. I have lobbyists, I have to tell you - I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Political Stagecraft, and the Islamic State </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's been no crowd like this. And I can tell you, some of the candidates, they went in, they didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they gonna beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The real estate mogul and reality television star, whose numerous feints at running for office haven&amp;#8217;t resulted in an actual candidacy, is expected to formally declare his campaign for president on Tuesday. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where a confidant of Hillary Rodham Clinton is set to testify to a House committee about the attacks in Benghazi, Libya. As for the presidential candidates, the crowded Republican field finally found room for Jeb Bush, and now, it might have to again move over for a hopeful who needs only one name: Trump.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Donald Trump day is upon us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real estate mogul and reality television star, whose numerous feints at running for office haven't resulted in an actual candidacy, is expected to formally declare his campaign for president on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in the atrium at - where else? - Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump will most likely lay out his plan to finally be a part of a Republican race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given his standing in the polls, Mr. Trump will also most likely be a presence in the Republican debates, which are to be limited to 10 participants. That raises some potentially difficult prospects for the other candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the man who is known for his gold-plated logo, his pouf of hair and the catchphrase &quot;You're fired!&quot; has long coveted credibility in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has yet to say publicly whether he would pledge to remain in the race through the Iowa caucuses early next year, or whether he would be open to renewing his television show, &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday, he is guaranteed to be the center of Republican attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maggie Haberman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Watching Today </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Bush will appear on the &quot;The Tonight Show Starring  Jimmy Fallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will speak at the White House Clean Energy Investment Summit meeting, a gathering of &quot;leaders in the private and philanthropic sectors,&quot; to discuss financing &quot;climate change solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on a relatively slow day on the trail, former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, a Democrat and one of the few remaining hopefuls yet to announce, will make at least two appearances in Des Moines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sidney Blumenthal, Clinton Aide, Takes a Hot Seat in the House </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sidney Blumenthal, Mrs. Clinton's longtime adviser and confidant, is scheduled on Tuesday to spend several hours behind closed doors with members of the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee's chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wants to question Mr. Blumenthal about dozens of intelligence memos he sent to Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state. At the time, Mr. Blumenthal was not working at the State Department, and he was being paid by the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Gowdy wants to ask Mr. Blumenthal who his sources were for the information he was feeding Mrs. Clinton, whether he was trying to secure contracts from the Libyan government and if she solicited his memos. (Mrs. Clinton has said she didn't.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Gowdy questions Mr. Blumenthal, the committee's Democrats will have a chance to do the same. The committee will most likely release a transcript of Mr. Blumenthal's testimony, although it is not clear how soon that will happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a subpoena from Mr. Gowdy, Mr. Blumenthal gave the committee dozens of pages of emails he sent Mrs. Clinton that the State Department had not provided to the committee. That production has increased the tension between the State Department and the panel, which contends that the department has not handed over all the requested documents because it wants to protect Mrs. Clinton. So far, at least, the Libya story line, as well as that of her use of a personal email address in the State Department and of the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign donations, have not registered with many voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Michael S. Schmidt </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kasich Circles the Runway, but Looks Ready to Land </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In yet another sign that he is all but certain to announce his candidacy for president, Governor John R. Kasich of Ohio will appear on Tuesday in the early primary state of Michigan, part of a busy stretch of travel that will culminate with a trip to Iowa - his first attempt to court 2016 voters there - this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kasich has been toying for months with jumping into the 2016 Republican primary race; in recent weeks, he has been courting donors and building a political operation. He is widely expected to announce his candidacy in July, though he publicly insists he has made no decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would make him a late entry into a crowded field - but still give him time, his advisers say, to improve his standing in the polls enough to make the cut for the Aug. 6 presidential debate, in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Michigan visit comes as Mr. Kasich is stepping up his travel. He was in South Carolina on Monday; on Wednesday, he will be in New Hampshire; and on Friday, he plans to be in Washington, D.C. In Michigan, he is scheduled to address a small business group in Lansing and to attend an evening reception hosted by the Ingham County Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His strategy isn't 'I'm going to pull an upset in Iowa' or 'I have to win in New Hampshire,' &quot; said one person close to Mr. Kasich, speaking anonymously to discuss his thinking. &quot;It's 'I'm going to compete aggressively in a broad spectrum of all the early primaries and demonstrate that I have staying power.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Sheryl Gay Stolberg </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Favorites From Today's Times </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Clinton, who has shown signs of trying to contrast herself with President Obama, pushed on Monday to expand her efforts to improve access to prekindergarten for moderate- and low-income families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional Republican leaders and the White House ticked through a list of complicated procedural options as they sought a way to resurrect the trade legislation that was stalled last week by Democrats, dealing Mr. Obama an embarrassing defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And since Mr. Bush owned the news cycle with his announcement, here is a look at what he would need to do to win, his stance on crucial issues and an analysis by The Upshot of an economic pledge he made in his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Reading Elsewhere </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Concord Monitor spoke to Mrs. Clinton in &quot;one of the first&quot; sit-down interviews she's done during the campaign, and recapped the conversation, &quot;which lasted just under 10 minutes.&quot;And Jake Tapper at CNN cites &quot;45 times&quot; that she &quot;pushed the trade deal&quot; about which she has now, after many calls for her to take a stance as a candidate, raised some clearer reservations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alan Wolfe, a political-science professor at Boston College, writes for Reuters that Libertarianism, which has gained some popularity in the United States with the rise of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, &quot;has a complicated history,&quot; and might be &quot;closer to Stalinism than you think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Clinton might want to be worried about the large number of fans Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is turning out to his rallies, Politico reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Michelle Obama writes in The Financial Times that there are 62 million girls &quot;around the world&quot; who are unable to attend school, a number that is &quot;a serious public health issue,&quot; an &quot;urgent economic issue,&quot; and is &quot;deeply personal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump, the garrulous real estate developer whose name has adorned apartment buildings, hotels, Trump-brand neckties and Trump-brand steaks, announced on Tuesday his entry into the 2016 presidential race, brandishing his wealth and fame as chief qualifications in an improbable quest for the Republican nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in the atrium of the Trump Tower, the luxury skyscraper on Fifth Avenue in New York City, proclaiming that only someone ''really rich'' -- like himself -- could restore American economic primacy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   ''We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again,'' he said, repeatedly assailing China and Mexico as economic competitors, and pledging to be ''the greatest jobs president that God ever created.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Trump, 69, has long toyed with running for president as a Republican, boasting of his credentials as an entrepreneur and mocking the accomplishments of prominent elected officials. He has used the platform of a reality television show, NBC's ''The Apprentice,'' to burnish his pop-culture image as a formidable man of affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   It seems a remote prospect that Republicans, stung in 2012 by the caricature of their nominee, Mitt Romney, as a pampered and politically tone-deaf financier, would rebound by nominating a real estate magnate who has published books with titles such as, ''Think Like a Billionaire'' and ''Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich -- And Why Most Don't.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   But Mr. Trump, who has never held elective office, may not be so easily confined to the margins of the 2016 campaign. Thanks to his enormous media profile, he stands a good chance of qualifying for nationally televised debates, where his appetite for combat and skill at playing to the gallery could make him a powerfully disruptive presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In the past, Mr. Trump's presidential posturing has seldom been taken seriously, and for good reason: Before the 2000 and 2012 elections, he hyped up the possibility of seeking the White House before abandoning the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Trump's remarks in Midtown Manhattan were unlikely to allay suspicions that he is entering the race mainly to appear in debates and win attention from the media. He bragged extensively about the golf resorts he owns (''I have the best courses in the world'') and a hotel he is developing in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Over the course of a more than 40-minute speech, Mr. Trump warned that the stock market may collapse again and ridiculed Secretary of State John F. Kerry for having broken his leg in a bicycle accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   But Mr. Trump and his allies insist that he is serious about the race. He said he would file all the financial disclosure forms required by the Federal Election Commission, without requesting any extensions from the government. At one point, Mr. Trump held up a one-page document -- compiled, he said, by a prominent accounting firm -- purporting to show his net worth at around $8.7 billion, with nearly all of his estimated assets in the form of property and licensing deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokeswoman said he would fill out the election commission paperwork in full, though it is unclear whether Mr. Trump will make a more complete disclosure of tax returns, as is customary for credible presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Associates say Mr. Trump is willing, even eager, to spend his fortune in the race, and has hired staff in the early nominating states.  ''He has said a couple of times that he could easily put $100 million into the race and that he feels that would not impact him financially,'' said Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Mr. Trump's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Ruddy, who is chief executive of Newsmax, the conservative magazine and website, said Mr. Trump would bring an unaccustomed level of glamour to the Republican field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   ''He's got that celebrity status,'' Mr. Ruddy said. ''Republicans sort of crave that, because we don't have it, generally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Geraldo Rivera, the veteran broadcaster who was a finalist on ''Celebrity Apprentice,'' said Mr. Trump would quickly leave a mark on the race thanks to his ability as a showman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   ''Right now, Jeb Bush is announcing,'' Mr. Rivera said Monday afternoon. ''Who would you rather watch, him or Trump?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   But as well-known as he is, Mr. Trump is also widely disliked: A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that about seven in 10 voters nationally hold an unfavorable view of him, including 52 percent of Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Trump has shown he is eager to scuffle with other Republicans, including Mr. Bush. He has spoken contemptuously, in public and private, about the former Florida governor, and swiped at him repeatedly during the kickoff event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   ''I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination,'' he said of Mr. Bush. ''He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Trump's policy views can be just as provocative as his demeanor. In the past, he has called  climate change ''a hoax'' and said he has a ''foolproof'' plan to defeat the Islamic State, which he will not reveal so as not to tip off the group. On Tuesday, he vowed to build a ''great wall'' on the Mexican border to keep out rapists and other criminals, who he said were sneaking into the United States in droves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Until now, Mr. Trump may be best known politically for his outspoken skepticism that President Obama was born in the United States. After his insistent demands during the 2012 race that Mr. Obama release his birth certificate, the president ultimately did just that, confirming he was born in Hawaii.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Trump has donated money to both parties, including to Democrats such as Hillary Rodham Clinton. When he last entertained a presidential bid four years ago, the conservative Club for Growth labeled him a liberal for his views on trade and his past support for universal health care, and accused him of having exploited government powers, including the use of eminent domain, to expand his real estate holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   If Mr. Trump's ideology has proved flexible, the cornerstone of his worldview has not: He has consistently been a passionate believer in Donald&nbsp;Trump, and his own capacity to bully and badger his way into the best possible deal. That skill set, Mr. Trump has argued, would be an asset to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   At present, Mr. Trump said, rivals on the world stage do not take the United States seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   ''They say: that is a group of people, and that is a nation, that truly has no clue,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new television station has stepped in to broadcast Donald Trump's Miss USA beauty pageant: Reelz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cable channel, which is available in about 60 percent of the country's homes and reaches about 70 million viewers, will show the pageant on July 12. The move comes after the decision by NBC and Univision, the Spanish-language broadcaster, to drop their plans to show Miss USA, citing recent comments by Mr. Trump about immigrants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stan E. Hubbard, the chief executive of Reelz, said in a statement on Thursday that the Miss USA pageant was the ''perfect fit'' for his cable network and ''this decision is about the dreams of the contestants who come from all walks of life across the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The decision on the part of Reelz to acquire the rights to the Miss USA pageant was based on our belief that this special event, and the women who compete in it, are an integral part of American tradition,'' Mr. Hubbard said. ''As one of only a few independent networks, we decided to exercise our own voice and committed ourselves to bringing this pageant to American viewers everywhere.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even though the pageant now has a broadcaster, it still faces challenges in replacing some performers. Two of the co-hosts, Thomas Roberts and Cheryl Burke, dropped out, but another, Jeannie Mai, a daytime talk show host, is staying, saying she couldn't abandon the contestants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is not the first time that Reelz, based in Albuquerque, N.M., has stepped in after a controversy. In 2011, the cable channel broadcast the mini-series ''The Kennedys'' after the History channel dropped it, saying that it was a ''dramatic interpretation'' that was not in line with the company's brand. The mini-series subsequently set ratings records for Reelz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the last week, a slew of companies, including Macy's and the mattress company Serta, have cut ties with Mr. Trump after his remarks in his presidential campaign announcement in which he said some immigrants were ''rapists'' and ''killers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Univision pulled out, Mr. Trump filed a $500 million lawsuit against the network, saying it had violated its five-year, $13.5 million contract to broadcast various Miss Universe beauty pageants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BATON ROUGE, La. --  The symbolism wasn't lost on the organizers and contestants of the 2015 Miss USA pageant Wednesday evening as thunderstorms drenched the public sports park where their first official media event was scheduled to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Storm clouds have been following the Miss USA beauty pageant all week. For several days, the event was left without a broadcaster after first Univision and then NBC pulled out of broadcasting the July 12 pageant, following an uproar over remarks made by Donald J. Trump about immigrants in mid-June. Mr. Trump owns 49 percent of the Miss Universe Organization that includes the Miss USA pageant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The moves will almost certainly result in a diminished television audience for the event, but it will not go dark. On Thursday, the cable network Reelz announced it would broadcast the pageant. The decision ''was based on our belief that this special event, and the women who compete in it, are an integral part of American tradition,'' said Stan E. Hubbard, the chief executive of Reelz.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it is a tradition that is something of an anachronism these days as beauty pageants have faded as a beloved institution, and now the organizers of Miss USA are further burdened by getting caught in the center of a political storm. Mr. Trump, who is running for president as a Republican, unleashed a flood of protest when he said during his campaign announcement that some Mexican immigrants were ''rapists'' and ''killers.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has stood by his remarks, and sued Univision for $500 million, saying it breached its commitment to televise the pageant. He has been removed as host of NBC's ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' and likewise lost deals with Macy's and the mattress company Serta, all in the last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reelz, an obscure cable channel that's best known for its lineup of movies, is available in about 60 percent of the country, a fraction of the reach of a national network like NBC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And amid the furor, the contestants have ended up as collateral damage, waiting to learn the fate of the pageant as networks, co-hosts, judges and performers abandoned it. They acknowledged that the reduced television exposure detracted from its glamour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You were always able to get those viewers who were just flipping through the channels, looking for something, and then, bam, pretty girls,'' said Laura Puleo, Miss Virginia, at the event Wednesday night. ''But now there's a lot of attention on the pageant for different reasons. I'm not going to lie, the TV thing is a Debbie Downer moment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Miss North Carolina, Julia Dalton, said she too was concerned about NBC dropping the broadcast, especially because she remembers watching pageants on TV as a young girl with her mother, who was Miss North Carolina 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I can remember playing with all of her crowns and dresses and watching the pageant on TV with her,'' Ms. Dalton said. ''It's sad to think that there are young girls out there who won't be able to experience it the same way I did. But the show must go on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the brewing controversy, the show goes on, as did the event at the sports park, billed as the Miss USA ''Extreme Sports Outing!'' As the skies cleared Wednesday, about a dozen contestants -- sashes declaring homesteads in Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina and other states -- posed for group photos and collectively screamed ''Woo-hoo'' for the organization's film crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's being recorded for something,'' said Jackie Shahinian, director of public relations for the Miss Universe Organization, nodding her head at the cameraman. ''For the show, wherever it airs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Women were mostly dressed in athletic wear, ranging from spandex biking shorts, sneakers and tank tops. Polikseni Manxhari, Miss Massachusetts, who was born in Albania, stood in the shadow of a 35-foot rock wall that her fellow contestants were climbing during a promotional shoot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I started watching Miss USA by the time I was 10, and for me, it was all about the pride I felt in having come to the United States,'' she said. ''That's when I decided that was what I wanted to do. That was my American dream.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When asked about Mr. Trump, she was diplomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For a lot of people, they think that was offensive,'' Ms. Manxhari continued, before pausing. ''For me, I'm taking it day by day and being as positive about everything as I can. There's nothing negative I'm going to say about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week Miss California, Natasha Martinez, whose mother was born in Nicaragua and father is Mexican-American, told KCAL-TV in Los Angeles that Mr. Trump's comments were ''hurtful.'' But other contestants, like Rashontae Wawrzyniak, representing Michigan, were quick to defend Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I support his right to free speech,'' Ms. Wawrzyniak said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Miss New Hampshire Samantha Poirier said the media firestorm and uncertainty has likely forged friendships uncommon to the pageant in the past. ''We're all going through the same thing,'' she said. ''This has bonded us all together, if nothing else.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contestants will certainly be the featured attraction this year. Two co-hosts, Cheryl Burke of ''Dancing With The Stars'' and Thomas Roberts of MSNBC, have pulled out of the pageant in protest of Mr. Trump's remarks, as have musical performer Flo Rida and two judges -- Jonathan Scott of HGTV and Emmitt Smith, the former Dallas Cowboys running back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, Jay Dardenne, Louisiana's lieutenant governor, has so far refused to pay the Miss Universe Organization $65,000 in tourism incentives from his office, saying that the lack of a network TV partner diminishes the event as an attraction, Jacques Berry, a spokesman for the office of the lieutenant governor, said no payments will be made until after the pageant is completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are still some concerns about there being a smaller audience and no major network signed on to promote the event,'' Mr. Berry said. John Delgado, a member of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council, said he and other city officials are looking into whether the city could recoup a portion of the $200,000 it agreed to pay the Miss Universe Organization. And he's encouraging the city's tourism arm, Visit Baton Rouge, to withhold payment as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Miss USA pageant is in breach of its contract,'' Mr. Delgado said in an interview. ''This was supposed be a three-hour tourism video on a major network for Baton Rouge.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Baton Rouge park Wednesday, Virginia's Ms. Puleo, dressed in a T-shirt and biking shorts, wondered if all the talk about the pageant, however negative, might turn out to be a boon for the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The attention the pageant is getting is huge,'' she said. Grinning, she added, ''Whether that was actually calculated by Donald&nbsp;Trump, I don't know.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has had a bad week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trouble began with his inflammatory remarks about Mexican immigrants during a speech to announce his presidential candidacy on June 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,'' Mr. Trump declared. ''They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the next week, each day seemed to bring a fresh blow to Mr. Trump. A brief review of the wreckage might make you feel better about your troubles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The business impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The remarks set off a cascade of condemnation that engulfed some of his business dealings, beginning late last week with Univision announcing that it would no longer carry the Trump-produced Miss USA or Miss Universe pageants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This week, more companies followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, NBCUniversal cut all ties with Mr. Trump, saying it would no longer air the pageants or ''The Apprentice.'' Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language media company, also cut ties. Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, scrapped a television project. And in Chicago, 5 Rabbit Cerveceria pulled out of a beer partnership with a Trump Hotel bar, then renamed some of its beers in a vulgar tribute to Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, Mr. Trump sued Univision, accusing it of violating its contract. Meanwhile, Farouk Systems, a hairdressing company, dropped sponsorship of the pageants and involvement in ''The Celebrity Apprentice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, Macy's said it would drop his fashion line, which had been sold in the store since 2004. (If all that wasn't enough, his hotel chain said it was investigating a possible payment card data breach.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petitions created on Change.org and MoveOn.org are pressuring other companies to cut Mr. Trump loose, suggesting the financial toll could continue to build.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mockery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As one might expect, late-night comedians have had a field day. Jimmy Kimmel joked that NBC's rejection of Mr. Trump's beauty pageants was not because they ''treat women like cattle at a state fair. It was the thing about Mexicans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others had more pointed responses. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, while announcing that the city is reviewing its contracts with Mr. Trump, said his comments ''do not represent the values of inclusion and openness that define us as New Yorkers.'' America Ferrera, the actress, said Mr. Trump lives ''in an outdated fantasy of a bigoted America.'' Eva Longoria invoked Hitler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has gained infamy in Mexico too, where an array of political figures lashed out at the remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And yet, polling remains solid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But its wasn't all bad for Mr. Trump. In several recent polls he has trailed only Jeb Bush in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, whether nationally or in key states like New Hampshire and Iowa. Plus he can count Senator Ted Cruz among his defenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is unchastened. He has not apologized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Nothing that I stated was different from what I have been saying for many years,'' Mr. Trump said in a statement on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, whose wife is Mexican, showed a flash of anger on Saturday as he said that he &amp;#8220;absolutely&amp;#8221; took personal offense when Donald Trump recently described Mexican immigrants coming to the United States as &amp;#8220;rapists&amp;#8221; and criminals. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MERRIMACK, N.H. - Jeb Bush, whose wife is Mexican and three children were raised to celebrate their bicultural roots, showed a flash of anger on Saturday as he said that he &quot;absolutely&quot; took personal offense when Donald&nbsp;Trump recently described Mexican immigrants coming to the United States as &quot;rapists&quot; and criminals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, used his strongest language yet to denounce Mr. Trump, a rival for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and the second-place finisher behind Mr. Bush in a New Hampshire poll that was conducted after Mr. Trump made those remarks. Mr. Bush, after marching in an Independence Day parade here with two of his children, George and Noelle, said that Mr. Trump's views are &quot;way out of the mainstream&quot; of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party,&quot; Mr. Bush said about Mr. Trump, whose comments caused NBC, Univision, Macy's and others to cut ties with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's doing this - he's not a stupid guy, so I don't assume he thinks that every Mexican crossing the border is a rapist. He's doing this to inflame and incite and to draw attention, which seems to be the organizing principle of his campaign,&quot; Mr. Bush said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he took Mr. Trump's remarks personally, given his family, Mr. Bush became a little cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, of course it - absolutely - and a lot of other people&quot; did as well, he said. &quot;But politically, we're going to win when we're hopeful and optimistic and big and broad rather than errrrr, grrrr, just angry all the time. This is an exaggerated form of that, and there is no tolerance for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Republican candidate, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, gave a different answer on Friday when asked about Mr. Trump, a longtime friend. He criticized Mr. Trump's remarks but then appeared to vouch for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like Donald. He's a good guy,&quot; Mr. Christie said. &quot;And as I said right from the beginning, he'll be as serious a candidate as he wants to be. Those are his choices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney criticized the real-estate mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday, saying he was damaging the Republican Party with his comments linking Mexican immigrants to crime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, spoke at a Fourth of July parade in Wolfeboro, N.H., where he owns a home. He was asked whether Mr. Trump's comments depicting Mexican immigrants as violent predators had hurt a party that has been trying to make inroads with Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, in remarks reported by CNN. &quot;I think he made a severe error in saying what he did about Mexican-Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Mr. Trump's Republican rivals, like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former governors Jeb Bush of Florida and George E. Pataki of New York, have also taken issue with his comments. And the Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has been alluding to the comments in trying to portray the Republican field as a whole as anti-immigrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Party leaders agonize over the prospect that Donald Trump will mount a third-party candidacy that could undermine their nominee. They fear insulting the white working-class voters who admire him. They are loath to tangle with a threat-flinging firebrand for whom there are no rules of engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the start of Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, a vexing question has hovered over his candidacy: Why have so many party leaders -- privately appalled by Mr. Trump's remarks about immigrants from Mexico -- not renounced him? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It turns out, interviews show, that the mathematical delicacy of a Republican victory in 2016 -- and its dependence on aging, anxious white voters -- make it exceedingly perilous for the Republican Party to treat Mr. Trump as the pariah many of its leaders now wish he would become.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as a cascade of corporations and business partners -- from NBC and Macy's to the chefs at two planned restaurants -- rush to sever their ties with Mr. Trump, Republican leaders seem deeply torn and paralyzed by indecision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few weeks ago, those divisions were on vivid display at a regular gathering of top Republican elected officials, strategists and the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Over dinner at the Hay-Adams Hotel opposite the White House, some argued for a swift response, fearing Mr. Trump would mar the coming Republican presidential debates with his needless provocations. Others counseled a hands-off approach, fearing attempts to rein him in would only turn him into a political martyr and, worse, tempt him toward that third-party run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No consensus was reached, and the party chairman, Reince Priebus, left with no clear directive, according to two attendees at the dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dispirited party elders, worried that Republicans are handing Democratic rivals a powerful campaign weapon by allowing Mr. Trump's voice to be depicted as representative of the party, are sounding the alarm with growing urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Republican Party is making a mistake if they think they can just remain quiet when he speaks up, or to demur or to just lightly distance themselves,'' said Peter Wehner, a former official in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. ''He's doing tremendous damage.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump, the New York developer, reality television host and political provocateur, shows no signs of backing off from his remarks, made during his announcement of a campaign for the White House three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,'' he said then. ''They're sending people that have lots of problems. And they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the days after, there has been a striking absence of public denunciations of Mr. Trump from leading Republican candidates for president and the party's top officials in Washington. Only last weekend did Jeb Bush -- after a muted earlier response -- call the ''rapists'' comment ''extraordinarily ugly'' and ''not reflective of the Republican Party.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Priebus took a quieter route on Wednesday in a brief telephone conversation with Mr. Trump, urging him to soften his tone on immigrants even as he offered praise of his candidacy, according to Mr. Trump and others told of the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In classic form, though, Mr. Trump quickly thanked the party chairman with acerbic broadsides that could discourage similar attempts to rein him in. Mr. Trump reached out to a New York Times reporter Thursday morning to say the call was ''congratulatory,'' not condemnatory, and posit that Mr. Priebus ''knows better than to lecture me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added, ''We're not dealing with a five-star Army general.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump's language about Mexicans highlighted two of the most divisive issues within the Republican coalition -- race and immigration. It was Mr. Priebus who led a bracing review of the party's 2012 losses, resulting in dire warnings about its need to improve its standing with Hispanics. But Mr. Trump's support is expected to draw heavily from those disaffected white voters who lined up behind Mitt Romney in 2012 -- and whom Republicans acknowledge they will need again to recapture the White House in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As a presidential candidate, he's taking a problem we already have as a party and making it worse,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, another White House aspirant. ''If we continue this we're going to accelerate the demographic death spiral we're in.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To a degree, the party's problems with Mr. Trump have come full circle. He first gained attention among Republicans, including Mr. Priebus, when he flirted with a presidential run in 2012, gaining a following as someone who viscerally attacked President Obama. Mr. Trump eventually bowed out, though he continued to question Mr. Obama's birthplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, what remains so appealing to many of the white voters who like Mr. Trump is his perceived willingness to tell hard truths about delicate issues -- racial and otherwise -- that, to their mind, the party establishment is too timid to discuss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are a lot of people who are very angry at the grass-roots level and who are convinced the Republican leaders in Congress are not doing everything for the conservative cause,'' said Charlie Black, a former adviser to John McCain in 2008 and Mr. Romney in 2012. Mr. Trump, he said, holds undeniable appeal to such voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A poll released by the Pew Research Center in May found that 63 percent of Republican voters view immigrants as a ''burden'' who compete for jobs, housing, and health care compared with 32 percent of Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Trump also risks alienating from Republicans a crucial bloc of swing voters who lean right on economics but disdain any hint of scapegoating minorities -- not to mention a cross-section of minority voters who are offended by his message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Republicans have a tremendous opportunity with Latino voters in 2016,'' said George E. Pataki, a Republican candidate who described Mr. Trump's words as ''slandering'' and called on his fellow candidates to firmly denounce them. ''To lose that opportunity over divisive rhetoric would be tragic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But any top-down campaign by Republicans to marginalize Mr. Trump might encourage him to follow through with a threat to run on a third-party ballot, a scenario reminiscent of Ross Perot's 1992 campaign, which diverted crucial votes from President George Bush. Many in the party still blame Mr. Perot, who won 19 percent of the vote, for Mr. Bush's defeat to Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Perot's intensely nationalist and protectionist politics resonated with a lot of center-right voters that otherwise would have voted Republican,'' said Dan Senor, a former Bush administration official who advised Mr. Romney's campaign. ''And the environment today is even more intensely populist. If Trump were to run as an independent, who knows what impact he could have in what will otherwise be a close election?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That possibility, said Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, is reason enough for the party not to attack Mr. Trump. ''You've got to keep him in the tent,'' Mr. Davis said. ''He just wreaks havoc, and every vote he takes comes out of our hide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the party's first debate scheduled for Aug. 6, Republicans are absorbing the likelihood that Mr. Trump, and his parade of provocations, will be on stage. Fox News has set criteria for participation primarily on the candidates' standing in national polls, and Mr. Trump is now comfortably ensconced in the top 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's 100 percent going to do the debates,'' said Michael Cohen, an adviser to Mr. Trump. ''I believe he's either leading or tied for first place in the polls, and certainly qualifies to have a seat on the stage.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump was aware that party bosses were wringing their hands over his presence in the field. ''They fear him because he's not part of the establishment,'' Mr. Cohen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Latino Republican officials said they were dumbfounded by the reluctance of other Republicans to deliver full-throated rebukes of Mr. Trump -- and suggested the debates might provide that opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Republican Party is going to have to be much more aggressive in dealing with him,'' said Hector V. Barreto, who has advised every Republican presidential campaign since 2000. ''And I would expect my party to do that, to call him out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''Maybe this is our Sister Souljah moment when we say, 'He is not a Republican, he does not represent us, he needs to get off the stage.' ''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were criminals -- thugs and thieves -- a single ethnic group that filled the jails of big cities. ''Scum unloaded on American wharves,'' one speaker in Philadelphia said of them. Dirty, filthy, foreign. As for their children, they were ''utterly ignorant of a place such as school,'' The New York Herald reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexicans? No, the Irish of the 1850s, then pouring into Anglo-Saxon America at such a rate that it gave rise to a political party founded in opposition to immigration -- the Know-Nothings. At one point, it was second largest party in the United States, complete with a paramilitary arm called the Wide Awakes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly 50 years later, as Italians and other southern Europeans left their barren lands for hope in America, a prominent educator and writer, Francis A. Walker, expressed a widely held view of these new arrivals: ''They are beaten men from beaten races, representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald Trump -- we've found your century. The xenophobes have always been with us, sometimes in power, usually not. It's the mother of all ironies that a nation where all but about 2 percent (the Native Americans) of the population can trace its lineage to some distant land is now going through another of its anti-immigrant moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But good news: The 2015 version is a weak strain of the earlier tea. It will flush out those camped in the Republican Party who have long used code words and fabrications to hide their loathing of people who ''are not you,'' in Trump's phrase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I salute Donald Trump,'' said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, one of the first to be flushed, and also one of the jillion candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Cruz wants some of the immigrant-hatred vote, at least 10 percent of the primary audience, that has catapulted Trump to the top tier in polls. The other candidates are afraid of Trump. And Democrats, even the atheists, have become devout believers in a benevolent God, as Trump keeps delivering on their prayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It will only get better as Republican primaries move into all-white, anti-immigrant strongholds. Here, you can expect to see clusters of red-faced older men clutching copies of ''&iexcl;Adios, America! The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole,'' by the polemicist Ann Coulter. Here's a sample line: ''Today's immigrants aren't coming here to breathe free, they are coming to live for free.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her book has influenced Trump, even as his hotel construction projects benefit from those same immigrants. No matter. If intellectual consistency were threads on Trump's head, he would be as bald as a snow globe. If this keeps up, the 27 percent share of the Latino vote that Republicans got in 2012 will look like a high-water mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  History is a guide here. The Chinese of the late 19th century were subject to exclusion laws and outright pogroms on the West Coast, and cast as inscrutable opium addicts. The major railroads probably could not have been built without them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Irish did make up a majority of people housed in New York's jails -- and the city's mental institution -- at one point. But they also dug the Erie Canal and provided the shovel muscle to remake the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new Know-Nothings have certainly kept fact-checkers busy. Mexicans: They're pouring across a porous border, yes? And with them comes something else -- ''tremendous infectious disease,'' said Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pouring is actually going the other way. Since 2006, more Mexicans have left the United States than have arrived, according to a Pew Research Center study in 2012. Since 2009, there's been a 50 percent drop in those trying to sneak across the border. A falling birthrate in Mexico, better economic opportunity at home, and economic stagnation in the United States are the contributing factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, President Obama has deported more undocumented immigrants than any of his predecessors. And doctors note that Mexico has a higher vaccination rate against disease than many United States communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for those who want to ''live for free,'' in Coulter's sneer, they better step up the mooching. Poor immigrants are less likely to take advantage of free government help than citizens, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, then, if they aren't leeches, Mexicans are still rapists and criminals, as Trump claimed. What about the oft-deported illegal held for murder in San Francisco? That killing looks more like a result of bureaucratic negligence, in part because of San Francisco's inane sanctuary policy, than a reason to go after job-seeking Latinos living in the shadows. Still, in conservative media circles, one murder proves the narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, first-generation immigrants have a much lower crime rate than the overall population. As to the rapists claim, whites accounted for 71 percent of all sexual assaults in 2013, even though they are only 63 percent of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Latinos, though 17 percent of the population, committed 9 percent of sex crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other words, whites are far more likely to meet Trump's description than Latinos. But don't expect to hear that statistic, or any other that sets the record straight, during a presidential debate. Whites make up an overwhelming majority of the Republican primary base. You can insult your audience's intelligence, but not to their face.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHOENIX -- Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and reality television star who has taken center stage in the race for the Republican presidential nomination this week, delivered a rambling monologue on Saturday, dismissing a long list of critics -- including Jeb Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Macy's -- while rallying what he termed a new silent majority of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump had less to say about immigration, the topic on which his comments have garnered so much attention, than about those who have criticized him. For more than an hour, he ticked through a list of businesses and candidates who have tried to censure him since his long-shot campaign began three weeks ago, and made light of their practices and intelligence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''How can I be tied with this guy?'' Trump said of Mr. Bush, whom many consider the Republican front-runner. ''He's terrible. He's weak on immigration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The speech had a distinctly celebratory air as Mr. Trump lauded the ''massive'' crowds he has drawn and the attention he has brought to immigration and other issues that he said ''weak'' politicians were afraid to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also demonstrated what his party fears most about him: that he is an orator without regard for decorum who is willing to mock other Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The speech, hosted by the Republican Party of Maricopa County, drew several thousand people to the Phoenix Convention Center, making it one of the largest events for any candidate so far, though short of the crowd of 10,000 predicted by the Trump campaign. Outside, in the 100-degree desert heat, supporters who could not make it into the room waved American flags and sparred with a smaller but vocal group of protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The silent majority is back, and we're going to take our country back,'' Mr. Trump declared as he left the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, whose tactics in tracking down illegal immigrants drew national attention and a federal ruling against him for racial profiling in 2013, preceded Mr. Trump on stage at the businessman's invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he had earlier in the day in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump also brought to the stage Jamiel Shaw Sr., the father of a teenager killed in 2008 by an undocumented immigrant in Los Angeles, to share the story of his son's death and to endorse Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump's trip to the immigrant-heavy border region was the first since he asserted in his campaign announcement on June 16 that those crossing the United States-Mexico border illegally included rapists and criminals. Those remarks have earned Mr. Trump sharp criticism from business and political leaders across the country, including companies such as Macy's, Univision and NBC that have cut ties with him in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He came to Phoenix after addressing a series of private and public audiences Friday and Saturday in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This has become a movement because people don't know what's happening,'' Mr. Trump said. ''We can't be great if we don't have a border.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His welcome here was not entirely warm. Phoenix's vice mayor and several pro-immigrant groups had called for the city to bar him from speaking at the convention center, which it owns. Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, rejected those calls, saying he would respect Mr. Trump's right to free speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But just as Mr. Trump's presence in the nominating race has confounded national Republican leaders trying to expand the party's appeal to minority groups, his visit here posed a dilemma for state officials trying to distance themselves from the anti-immigrant policies of the recent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Arizona's senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Republicans, decided not to attend the event, as did the Republican governor, Doug Ducey. Mr. Flake also called on the Maricopa County Republican Party to rescind its invitation to Mr. Trump, a request that was ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Saturday, Mr. Flake said Mr. Trump's remarks, which he called ''intolerant'' and ''inaccurate,'' would hurt Republicans here and around the country as they attempt to appeal to a broader demographic of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Particularly in Arizona, we have had such a long stretch of this kind of rhetoric and this kind of talk,'' Mr. Flake said in a telephone interview before Mr. Trump's speech. ''We seem to be moving beyond that here, and this kind of rhetoric just pulls us back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For many here, the event revived an image of the state, embodied by Sheriff Arpaio, as unwelcoming and harsh in its enforcement of illegal immigration laws -- a perception that Mr. Ducey has worked hard to dispel. He barely discussed immigration during his campaign last year, and since taking office in January, he has worked to make his mark as a business-centric leader, focused on taxes and improving Arizona's beleaguered public education system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saturday's crowd, though, suggested that the topic remains a galvanizing force among the Republican Party's conservative base here. Many who had lined up outside the convention center said Mr. Trump was the only candidate willing to speak up about what they see as the risks of illegal immigration and the failures of federal law enforcement to solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm very interested in Mr. Trump,'' said Rod Patrick, a 72-year-old retired rancher and small business owner. ''It's not necessarily because he's a good guy, but I'm fed up with politicians.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steve Donaldson, 31, agreed, saying that Mr. Trump's experience in international business, rather than elective politics, made him the best-prepared candidate for the presidency. Mr. Donaldson said Mr. Trump could have been more artful in crafting his points about illegal immigration, in particular, but thought that the abrasive approach was actually helping him in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think his delivery on some of his points could use a little finesse,'' he said, ''but that's also what I like most about him.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump's entry into the race for the Republican presidential nomination amounts to his first actual foray into elective politics after several threats. A real estate developer and host of ''The Celebrity Apprentice,'' he opines about many issues in colorful terms, and is fast on the trigger with denunciations, but does not always make his own policy recommendations clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Policy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump claimed last month that he had devised a ''foolproof way'' to defeat the Islamic State ''very quickly.'' But he refused to divulge it, saying he did not ''want the enemy to know what I'm doing.'' He calls President Obama ''one of the worst things that's ever happened to Israel,'' and blames him for deteriorating U.S.-Israeli relations. He says Russian-backed separatists are acting aggressively in Ukraine because the United States is ''not a respected country and we don't have respected leadership at this moment'' -- but says America's European allies should confront Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Immigration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump -- whose mother emigrated from Scotland -- says illegal immigrants are ''destroying the fabric of the country'' while the middle class is getting ''decimated.'' He opposes efforts to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, calling that a ''suicide mission'' for Republicans because ''every one of those 11 million people will be voting Democratic.'' He proposes instead to fortify the nation's borders by building ''a real wall'' to keep immigrants out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Same-Sex Marriage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump says that his views on marriage are ''evolving'' but that he still favors ''traditional marriage,'' between ''a man and a woman.'' (He has been married three times.) Same-sex marriage, he says, isn't his ''thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Environment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He does not just deny that climate change is occurring; he calls it a hoax, and says those who warn of global warming only want to raise taxes. He is less outspoken on other environmental issues, though he sued unsuccessfully in 2013 to block plans for wind turbines in Scotland that would power 65,000 homes, arguing, in part, that they would mar the view from a golf course he was proposing to build.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Economy and Budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump believes reckless government borrowing and stimulative policies by the Federal Reserve threaten the long-term health of the American economy and undermine the dollar, which, he said in 2012, ''is going to go to hell.'' He strongly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, calling it ''an attack on America's business'' that fails to penalize Asian nations like Japan when, he says, they engage in currency manipulation to boost exports. He takes particular aim at China, accusing it of currency manipulation and flooding the United States with low-cost exports that ''are truly hurting our economy and our jobs'' -- including, as it turns out, products with the Trump label. He attacked Mr. Obama last year for visiting China and ''celebrating the fact that they're ripping us off.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week after announcing his plans to run for president at a rally in New York, the billionaire businessman sealed the deal by filing signed documents with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Trump faced a deadline of July 1 to do so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am pleased to submit this filing to the Federal Election Commission, formalizing my campaign for president of the United States,&quot; Mr. Trump said Monday in a statement. &quot;I can rebuild the American Dream so that it is stronger, bigger and better than ever before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican candidate's campaign will be headquartered in New York City. Mr. Trump heads to Baltimore on Tuesday for a Maryland Republican Party dinner before traveling to Iowa on Saturday and New Hampshire next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. Trump boasts wide name recognition, he fails to register in many national polls, and some analysts doubt that he will be able to sustain his campaign beyond the early primary debates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. Trump says that his business record and message supporting a strong military and free markets will carry him to the nomination. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Macy&amp;#8217;s is ending its relationship with Mr. Trump and phasing out his line of suits, shirts and ties after remarks he made about Mexican immigrants. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another arm of Donald J. Trump's business empire is suffering repercussions from his presidential run: his fashion line. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macy's, the department store chain, is ending its relationship with Mr. Trump and phasing out his line of suits, shirts and ties after remarks he made about Mexican immigrants. During his presidential announcement earlier this month he called them &quot;killers&quot; and &quot;rapists&quot; while discussing the need for tougher border control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not believe the disparaging characterizations portray an accurate picture of the many Mexicans, Mexican Americans and Latinos who have made so many valuable contributions to the success of our nation,&quot; Macy's said in a statement. &quot;In light of statements made by Donald&nbsp;Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy's values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump and will phase-out the Trump menswear collection, which has been sold at Macy's since 2004.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backlash comes as Mr. Trump has performed well in early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire but is increasingly seeing his business interests under pressure now that his policy views are in the spotlight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes after a MoveOn.org petition that garnered more than 700,000 signaturescalling for Macy's to cut ties with Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The  decision by Macy's is the latest financial setback for Mr. Trump since he announced his candidacy for president. Univision, the Spanish language network,  already decided to end its relationship with him, canceling plans to air his Miss USA pageant in July, and NBC followed suit this week after a Change.org petition pressured the network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the networks for breach of contract. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pageant participants have also protested Mr. Trump's remarks, which he has continued to stand by. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that the breakup was his decision and was made because of pressure that Macy's was facing from outside groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called his relationship with the retailer small in terms of dollar volume and insignificant in comparison to his beliefs on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have always said that if you are successful, it is very hard to run for office, especially the office of president,&quot; Mr. Trump said. &quot;I have also continually stated that I am not beholden to anyone and this includes NBC and Macy's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defiant Mr. Trump also accused the companies of supporting illegal immigration and said he was never happy about the fact that the clothing the company sold bearing his name was made in China. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should I start a new product line somewhere in the future, I would insist that they are made in America,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier version of this story misstated NBC's plans for &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; which had been hosted by Donald J. Trump.  It did not cancel the show but  said it would seek a new host.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump filed a lawsuit against Univision for $500 million on Tuesday, following the network's announcement last week that it would no longer broadcast the Spanish-language version of his ''Miss USA'' beauty pageant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Univision, the popular Spanish-language broadcaster, ended its association with the event after Mr. Trump denounced immigrants as ''rapists'' and ''murderers'' while announcing two weeks ago that he would seek the Republican nomination for president. On Monday, NBC likewise said it would no longer broadcast ''Miss USA,'' which is taking place in Baton Rouge, La., on July 12. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Nothing that I stated was different from what I have been saying for many years,'' Mr. Trump said in a statement on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump contends that Univision was in violation of its contract by abandoning the broadcast. In the lawsuit, the Trump Organization said that Univision signed a five-year, $13.5 million contract this year to broadcast ''Miss USA'' and other Miss Universe pageants. The lawsuit also claims that Univision was trying to ''suppress Mr. Trump's freedom of speech.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lawsuit was filed in the New York Supreme Court. Mr. Trump is an owner of the Miss Universe Organization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We just reviewed Mr. Trump's complaint for the first time, and it is both factually false and legally ridiculous,'' Univision said in a statement. ''We will not only vigorously defend the case, but will continue to fight against Mr. Trump's ongoing efforts to run away from the derogatory comments he made on June 16 about Mexican immigrants.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also on Tuesday, both hosts for the ''Miss USA'' pageant, Thomas Roberts of MSNBC and Cheryl Burke, a model and TV host, said they would no longer participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In light of the recent statements made by Donald&nbsp;Trump and the subsequent decision by NBC to cut ties with Mr. Trump, I cannot in good conscience move forward with participating in this year's Miss USA Pageant as its co-host,'' Ms. Burke wrote in a Facebook post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NBC also said this week that Mr. Trump would not be back to host ''The Celebrity Apprentice,'' though it plans to keep the show on the air with a new host.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump said in his statement that ''Miss USA'' would go on as scheduled. An article in The Hollywood Reporter said the pageant would stream on the Miss USA website. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, the Miss Universe Organization said, ''It is unfortunate that recent events beyond our control have only served to negatively impact the women who participate in the pageant, our state directors, our sponsors and our fans.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Donald Trump has gone from sideshow to serious problem for Republicans as his comments that Mexican immigrants are &amp;#8220;rapists&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;killers&amp;#8221; risk staining the party. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good Thursday morning from Washington. As we head into the holiday, the campaign trail is crowded in Iowa, and Hillary Rodham Clinton released a large fund-raising figure as her emails while secretary of state continue to be parsed. And with news of another business partner deserting Donald J. Trump, he has put Republicans in a delicate spot, even as he finds some success in the polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Trump has gone from sideshow to serious problem for Republicans as his comments that Mexican immigrants are &quot;rapists&quot; and &quot;killers&quot; risk staining the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have struggled with the question of immigration overhaul for years, trying to balance a hard-line stance with the need to appeal to Hispanics. Now they have to say whether they agree with Mr. Trump's views.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats relish the situation. Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Trump's remarks &quot;emblematic&quot; and suggested that they were inappropriate talk-radio fodder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Bridge 21st Century, the Democratic &quot;super PAC,&quot; tried to tar the rest of the party with his views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald&nbsp;Trump is suddenly a force to be reckoned with in the G.O.P. primary, proving their rebrand is going splendidly,&quot; said Jessica Mackler, president of American Bridge. &quot;He's a great example of everything Republicans stand for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Trump, who has for years used the prospect of running for president to generate publicity, the attention may be a mixed blessing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump is performing surprisingly well in recent national polls and in New Hampshire and Iowa, the crucial primary season states. However, businesses like Univision, NBC Universal and Macy's have cut ties with him, dealing a financial blow to the billionaire who boasted that running for president would be cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The potential is Trump benefits from this politically because it keeps him in the spotlight,&quot; said Dan Hill, a crisis communications specialist. &quot;In terms of his brand and his business, obviously it's devastating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Mr. Trump's brand is built on outrageousness, refusing to soften his tone will most likely lift his standing with some Republicans, keep him afloat in polls and help him reach the debate stage. But if he continues to offend companies and their customers, a long campaign could be more costly than he expected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Watching Today </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the morning, the United States will release the unemployment numbers for June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And later in the day, President Obama, who is hoping to see those numbers fall from May, will be in Madison, Wis., to deliver a speech on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa is a popular choice for the candidates in the days before the Fourth of July. The Republicans, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who won the caucuses in 2008, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina will be there, as will Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, both Democrats. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mrs. Clinton are in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton's $45 Million War Chest Is a Limited Yardstick </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mrs. Clinton's aides announced her campaign fund-raising haul for the first three months of her candidacy - a war chest of $45 million - there were parallels drawn to the same fund-raising period for Mr. Obama in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He raised a few million less during that same quarter, the second one of that year, as a sitting president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that may be the closest measure, the reality is there hasn't been a candidate like Mrs. Clinton in modern memory, making comparisons difficult. She is a non-incumbent who nonetheless has the name recognition and party dominance of one, with the appeal of potentially being the first female president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The team is only looking to raise money for the primary.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will also be measured against herself, including in terms of her online fund-raising, and her campaign has not released those numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Maggie Haberman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republicans Have Options to Hinder Obama's Cuban Embassy Plans </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration might have had an easier time resolving its embassy issues with the Cuba than it will with the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anticipating the White House move to establish an embassy in Havana, the State Department spending bill facing consideration already contains new restrictions on what the administration can do in Cuba. And critics of the Cuba policy might even try to tighten those limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation would prevent the administration from spending any money for &quot;a United States diplomatic presence, including an embassy, consulate or liaison office, in Cuba&quot; beyond the facility in existence before Dec. 17, 2014, the day Mr. Obama initially announced he intended to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If approved, the provision could tie the administration's hands in expanding its operations in Havana even with Secretary of State John Kerry scheduled to head there to raise the American flag this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embassy funding isn't the only congressional obstacle on Cuba that Mr. Obama faces. Pushing an ambassador through the Republican-controlled Senate seems highly unlikely, particularly given the strong opposition of Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, presidential candidate and party point man on Cuba in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Carl Hulse </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Favorites From Today's Times </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Clinton, whose full embrace of gay rights has been relatively recent, is seemingly trying to make up for it now with a slew of events, including a fund-raiser in Provincetown, Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hard right turn by Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin hard turn to the right might hurt him outside of Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And two Republicans had some welcome, if early, good news, with Mr. Walker of Wisconsin finding himself atop another poll and Mr. Christie  securing an endorsement from Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after the Supreme Court delivered a second victory for his health care law, Mr. Obama flew into the mostly Republican state of Tennessee and began an aggressive push to get states that have resisted parts of the law to expand care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courting a Potential Kingmaker in South Carolina </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race to kiss the ring of Senator Tim Scott is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Scott, Republican of South Carolina, will be playing host to all 16 declared Republican White House candidates in town-hall-style events around his state over the next several months, beginning with Mr. Huckabee on Monday in Anderson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events will be similar to the ones Mr. Scott held in 2012 when he was a House member and Republicans raced toward him like deer to a salt lick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in 2012, however, when Mr. Scott made it clear he wouldn't be endorsing in the race, this time, his nod is up for grabs. School choice and education overhaul will be his pet policy issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Scott, like many lawmakers, has called for the Confederate battle flag to be removed from the state's capitol; Mr. Huckabee has said the flag was &quot;not an issue for a person running for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No word yet on how important he will consider this week's expiration of the federal charter of the Export-Import Bank to be. The bank has been a central component of the South Carolina economic resurgence; most Republican candidates oppose it. Next up: Former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York in Beaufort County. But most entertaining may be when he plays host to his state's senior senator, Mr. Graham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Jennifer Steinhauer </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Reading Elsewhere </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sanders, The Huffington Post writes, received a crucial endorsement of his own as he continues to draw closer to Mrs. Clinton in polls: that of Larry Cohen, the former head of the Communications Workers of America. &quot;One of the main factors in his decision, Cohen said,&quot; The Post reported, &quot;was Clinton's equivocation on granting President Barack Obama so-called fast-track authority on his mammoth trade deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Iowa on Wednesday, Mr. Paul said that not only could he win the Republican primary, he could also defeat Mrs. Clinton in a general election by winning many of the states that helped propel Mr. Obama to victory in 2008. The Des Moines Register was there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, according to the Pew Research Center, though &quot;some have come to worry that many - if not all - the issues connected to science are viewed by the public through a political lens,&quot; a broad analysis of these topics finds &quot;that the role of party and ideological differences is not uniform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post reportson how Democrats are cheering Mr. Trump's rise in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats are wondering why Mrs. Clinton's campaign doesn't unleash Bill Clinton to raise money for her super PAC, Politico reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peas Bring Obama and Bush Together </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Obama and Jeb Bush have found something they agree on: Guacamole is no place for peas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times on Wednesday posted a recipe on Twitter that recommended adding peas to the classic dish. The recipe, which started a debate on Twitter so raucous that Mr. Obama was asked about it, suggests that &quot;the peas add intense sweetness and a chunky texture to the dip, making it more substantial on the chip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama begged to differ. Asked about it in a Twitter chat on Wednesday, the president was steadfast in his support for the traditional recipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were few proponents of peas on Twitter and even Mr. Bush concurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama, the subject of guacamole is no laughing matter. Last year, he revealed that a good bowl of chips and guacamole was one of his weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lose my mind,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sam Sifton, The Times's food editor, noted that the newspaper had more than a dozen recipes for guacamole, but suggested on Twitter that Mr. Obama should keep his lost mind open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'll come 'round,&quot; Mr. Sifton posted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEXICO CITY -- It is the kind of publicity money cannot buy -- front-page coverage, segments on the nightly news, the attention of political heavyweights and a stream of commentary  burning a hole in the web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Donald J. Trump, champion of the so-called birther movement that wrongly questioned President Obama's birthplace, owner of the Miss Universe contest and developer of hotels bearing his name the world over, has not only found fame in the United States, where he is running for president. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has also found it in Mexico -- or infamy, anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's just ignorant,'' said Ricardo Arevala, 18, who works at a pi&ntilde;ata shop here, adding that someone recently came into the store looking for a smackable rendition of Mr. Trump. ''He speaks in stereotypes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While announcing his candidacy to be America's next president last month, Mr. Trump delivered remarks that ended up echoing across Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. They're rapists,'' Mr. Trump said about Mexican immigrants, adding, ''some, I assume, are good people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While most presidential candidates are positioning themselves to court the Latino vote, Mr. Trump ignited a firestorm with his statement, managing to galvanize the disparate populations of Mexico, both social and political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A host of Mexican political notables have lashed out at the remarks, including former President Felipe Calder&oacute;n.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A company controlled by Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecom magnate -- who is much, much richer than Mr. Trump, many Mexicans are quick to point out -- cut ties on a joint project with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Univision said it would not broadcast the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, which Mr. Trump partially owns the rights to, and Mexico as a nation has pulled out of the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation &amp; horrible trade deals. Forcing Univision to get me to stop- no way! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2015</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is to say nothing of the expletives cast around when describing Mr. Trump in much of Mexico, by every strata of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The blowback has struck on both sides of the border, of course. NBC severed ties with Mr. Trump. It is backing out of Miss USA and Miss Universe, which was a joint venture with Mr. Trump, although the show that helped resuscitate Mr. Trump's profile, ''Celebrity Apprentice'' (of the ''you're fired'' fame), will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Macy's stopped carrying a line of clothes branded by Mr. Trump, and Emmitt Smith, a football Hall of Famer, and Flo Rida, a rapper, now refuse to participate in the Miss USA pageant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Mexicans understand that as an archetypal capitalist, perhaps best known for real estate whose binding characteristic is a mammoth ''Trump'' sign, Mr. Trump does not do subtle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From his vast, rust-orange comb-over to his power suits, Mr. Trump plays for keeps, whether suing business partners for soured deals or issuing statements about his enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while Mr. Trump has defiantly refused to backtrack, there has been a bit of backpedaling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend. They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade. FIGHT! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2015</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has repeatedly assured the non-rapist and noncriminal Mexicans that he loves them and their country. He says he has done business with people from Mexico. He says he has great respect for Mexicans and ''their tremendous spirit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The feeling, it seems, is not entirely mutual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many have posted YouTube clips deriding the tycoon. Others have posted a litany of words online that, were they not directed at Mr. Trump, he might even appreciate. In the northern city of Reynosa, one pi&ntilde;ata maker has fashioned a model after him, coif and all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The price: about $35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his own defense, Mr. Trump has said that all anyone has to do is read the papers to know what is happening along the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What he said was true, he has fired back, adding that if people do not like that, they had better brace themselves for President Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His general rancor has increased from there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has called for a boycott of Macy's, slapped Univision with a $500 million lawsuit and called NBC ''weak and foolish.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My just filed lawsuit against Univision. Always fight back when right. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/ies96YzSeG -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2015</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump posted on his Instagram feed a personal letter from a Univision anchor, imploring him to come on the air and talk. The note included the anchor's cellphone number. He also told executives at Univision that if any of them or their representatives so much as set foot on his resorts, he would have them apprehended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while the fracas over his comments might have hurt his business relationships, they have not appeared to hurt him politically. They may even have helped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump has seen a bump in the polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire, where he is trailing behind the current Republican leader, Jeb Bush. But whatever his chances of coming to power, Mr. Trump, like others before him, seems to have tapped into a vein of resentment in American society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a popular narrative, after all, that those who cross the border into the United States are fleeing into the embrace of safety, prosperity and opportunity. And that flight, according to Mr. Trump, is precisely what he hopes to block.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We must have strong borders &amp; stop illegal immigration now!'' he said on Twitter, where he has more than three million followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But for many Mexicans, the reality is more complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ostensia Bonilla, the 56-year-old sales manager at a party supply shop in downtown Mexico City, has lived in the United States. She moved to Illinois in 2007 with her daughter but, after two years, decided to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was worried about the crowd she was hanging out with,'' she said. ''There were too many people selling and using drugs in her circle.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And like that, the family moved back, to avoid the very thing Mr. Trump has proclaimed that all of Mexico suffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Of course, we do have drug problems,'' she conceded, resting her hands on a wooden box filled with candy. ''And Mr. Trump has a right to free speech.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">590 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. Christie wants an apology from the media, and Mr. Trump is surprised that reaction to his anti-immigrant comments has been so &amp;#8220;severe.&amp;#8221; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While your attention is riveted on the competition for the Republican presidential nomination (well, maybe not riveted, or even focused, but maybe occasionally mildly interested), there is another contest among Republican politicians - to say the most obviously ridiculous thing that pops into their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders in this category are much easier to define than those in the nominating contest itself: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Chris Christie. Not only are the crazy things they say crazier than what the average Republican says, they really don't have anything at all to say that's worth hearing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Christie went on &quot;Morning Joe&quot; yesterday to demand an apology from the news media for the coverage of the Bridgegate scandal, in which top aides and close political allies hatched a plot to snarl traffic at the George Washington Bridge to punish a local politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were nightly specials on this network for about five months, calling me Attila the Hun,'' he said on MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure what Attila the Hun has to do with an episode that has resulted in federal charges being filed against three officials tied to Mr. Christie, one of whom has pleaded guilty. But news organizations, he explained, should say &quot;We're sorry, governor, for having jumped to conclusions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What conclusions? Apparently that he's responsible for creating an atmosphere in which his aides think that sort of sleazy corruption is acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm accountable,&quot; Mr. Christie explained. &quot;It happened on my watch. So you're accountable. It's different from being responsible. I think responsible is (for) if you did something. Accountable is, listen, it's on the governor, the buck stops with me. So I'm accountable. That's why I fired the folks I fired immediately.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, that clears things up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even farther down the road away from reality lies Mr. Trump. The reality-show host/beauty-pageant owner&nbsp;was surprised that the reaction has been &quot;this severe&quot; to his racist comments about Mexican migrants, whom he described as a gang of rapists and murderers being &quot;sent&quot; to this country by the Mexican government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out Mr. Trump was not really concerned about the general public's reaction to his remarks, but rather what he rather archly called his &quot;customers&quot; - presumably a reference to Univision and other companies that severed their business relationships with him. &quot;You know, maybe I'm leading in polls, but this is certainly not good,&quot; he said. &quot;I lose customers, I lose people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other Republican candidates were hard on Mr. Trump, with the exception of Ted Cruz, who may believe, or at least say, the largest number of idiotic things among the Republican contenders who have a slight claim to legitimacy as candidates. (Mr. Cruz is, at least, a United States Senator.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That group does not include Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, whose candidacy is the political equivalent of publishing your own record. (If you haven't heard William Shatner's version of &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,&quot; Google it and see what I mean.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to President Obama's attempts to grapple with racism in American society after the South Carolina church murders, Mr. Carson said: &quot;I think I would use the bully pulpit to help people realize what we have in common rather than what separates us.&nbsp;What it's been used for for the last several years is to create wars: a war on women, race wars, any kind of anything involving people of two different races, income wars, always class warfare, religious wars now, age wars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No further comment is possible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HUDSON, N.H. - Jeb Bush  declared Wednesday night that his love for his Mexican-American wife was entirely compatible with his views on tightening the border with Mexico, calling an online skirmish started by Donald Trump over the weekend &quot;ludicrous&quot; and &quot;bizarre.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering a question about squaring his affection for Mexican heritage with his approach to illegal immigration, Mr. Bush seemed eager to resolve the issue, which was raised in a message that Mr. Trump disseminated on Twitter on July 4 and later deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original message suggested that Mr. Bush was compelled to favor undocumented Mexican immigrants because his wife, Columba, is from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seizing on &quot;this weird little controversy I am not a big party to,&quot; Mr. Bush embarked on an expansive tribute to his wife during the question-and-answer portion of a town-hall-style meeting at a crowded veterans hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife is from Mexico,&quot; he said. &quot;I love her dearly. Been married for 41 years. I am not going to stop loving my wife. I'm pretty comfortable with that position. I'll stick with it for a while.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he continued: &quot;You can love the Mexican culture and love your Mexican-American wife and also believe we need to control the border. This is a bizarre kind of idea that somehow you can have an affection for people in a different country and not think the rule of law should apply. This is ludicrous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About five years ago, when golf was going through an economic downswing, Donald Trump took the opportunity to buy in, scooping up failed properties. He already had courses emblazoned with his name around the world, but credibility? That eluded him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon major golf tours came calling, bringing big-money, high-profile events to his courses. Major championships -- the prized possessions of every club -- came next. In short order, Trump had gone from outsider to having a seat in the club.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now he is wondering if he will get to keep it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've been very loyal to golf,'' Trump said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ''I own 17 clubs. They all do great. We will see whether or not golf is loyal to me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is the question after the P.G.A. of America on Tuesday became the first major golf organization to pull an event from one of Trump's properties in response to Trump's racially insensitive remarks last month about Mexican immigrants during a speech in which he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The P.G.A. Grand Slam of Golf -- a year-end exhibition among the winners of the four men's major championships -- was scheduled for October at Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, it will be moved to a yet-to-be-determined location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trump said it was a mutually agreed upon move to protect his friends in the organization from dealing with potential backlash over his remarks, in which he said, referring to Mexican immigrants: ''They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.'' He later added, ''And some, I assume, are good people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The P.G.A. and L.P.G.A. issued statements on Tuesday, with the P.G.A. saying ''we understand and support'' the decision. The L.P.G.A. said that the Women's British Open at Trump's Turnberry Resort later this month would be staged as scheduled, adding that ''a change in venue for this prestigious major simply isn't feasible without significantly diminishing the event.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think those statements are unnecessary,'' Trump said. ''The voters of this country agree with me. All you have to do is look at the polls.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trump later told a Golf Channel reporter days after the June 16 speech that he had ''tremendous support from the golf world, because they all know I'm right,'' referring to his remarks about Mexican immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That led the U.S.G.A., P.G.A. Tour, L.P.G.A. Tour and the P.G.A. of America to issue a joint statement disputing Trump's claims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But each organization has connected itself to Trump's growing golf empire in the past half-decade, staging and agreeing to hold marquee events at his courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the Women's British Open at the Turnberry Resort, which Trump purchased last year, three other major championships will be held at his courses by 2022: the 2017 United States Women's Open (at Trump National in Bedminster, N.J.), the 2017 Senior P.G.A. Championship (at Trump National in Potomac Falls, Va.) and the 2022 P.G.A. Championship at his Bedminster course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And as part of that deal last year with the P.G.A. of America, it moved the Grand Slam of Golf from its traditional home in Bermuda to Trump's Los Angeles course in a multiyear deal that runs through 2018. The P.G.A. of America's statement about the move, however, noted that it was for this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think a lot of people are surprised that it wasn't all or nothing,'' said the former P.G.A. of America president Ted Bishop. ''I don't know what kind of statement the P.G.A. of America makes by saying, 'We're not going to do this for one year, but we're going to go back for all these others.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bishop, who was ousted from the organization last year after he made public comments that were widely seen as sexist, was part of the group that entered into a multi-event deal with Trump in 2014. He said that both he and the former P.G.A. of America chief executive Joe Steranka originally wanted nothing to do with Trump or his growing grip on the sport. But once Pete Bevacqua took over for Steranka, he said, he pushed for the two sides to do more business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to his own original-design golf properties, Trump had increasingly begun acquiring more pieces of the golf market. He purchased the financially struggling properties in Colts Neck and Pine Hill, N.J. He bought the Doral Resort &amp; Spa -- and its famous Blue Monster course, which hosts the W.G.C.-Cadillac Championship -- out of bankruptcy in 2012. When the U.S.G.A. awarded him a United States Women's Open in 2012, the door had been opened for others to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if, at the end of the day, golf is not loyal back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I have wonderful alternatives,'' Trump said. ''It's called -- I'll make a fortune.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I keep reading that Donald Trump is wrecking the Republican Party. I keep hearing that he's a threat to the fortunes of every other Republican presidential candidate, because he sullies the brand and puts them in an impossible position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What bunk. The truth is that he's an opportunity for them as golden as the namesake nameplates on his phallic towers, if only they would seize it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The brand was plenty sullied before he lent his huff and his hair to the task. And by giving his Republican rivals a perfect foil, he also gives them a perfect chance to rehabilitate and redeem the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As it stands now, he's using them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If they had any guts, they could use him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They could piggyback on the outsize attention that he receives, answering his unhinged tweets and idiotic utterances with something sane and smart, knowing that it, too, would get prominent notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They could define themselves in the starkest possible contrast to him, calling him out as the bully and bigot that he is. Then he wouldn't own the story, because the narrative would be about cooler heads and kinder hearts in the party staring down one of its most needlessly divisive ambassadors and saying: Enough. No more. We're serious people at the limit of our patience for provocateurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was a hint of this last weekend, when Jeb Bush, whose wife is Mexican-American, lashed out at Trump's broad-brush comments about Mexican immigrants crossing into America with an agenda of drugs and rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bush labeled those remarks ''extraordinarily ugly'' and ''way out of the mainstream'' and said that there's ''no tolerance'' for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he didn't exactly volunteer that assessment. It came in response to a reporter's question, and it came more than two weeks after Trump's offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Neither he nor Marco Rubio exhibited any hurry in distancing themselves from Trump, though both of them trumpet their personal biographies as proof that they're sensitive to Latino immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Fox Business on Tuesday, Rubio gave a pathetic master class in cowardly evasion, stammering his way though an interview in which he was asked repeatedly for an opinion about Trump. You would have thought that he was being pressed for malicious gossip about the Easter bunny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He never did manage to upbraid Trump, though he was careful to mention the ''legitimate issue'' of border security that Trump had raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As in 2012, Republicans can't summon the courage to take on the dark heroes of the party's lunatic fringe. As in 2012, this could cost them dearly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Charleston, S.C., church massacre and subsequent debate over the Confederate flag afforded them an ideal moment to talk with passion and poetry about racial healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the leading contenders reacted in fashions either sluggish, terse, muffled or all three. They showed more interest in fleeing the subject than in grabbing profitable hold of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trump's rant about immigrants, which he has since amplified, was another squandered moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chris Christie could have made good on his boasts about always telling it like it is and being unconstrained by politesse. Instead he made clear that he liked Trump and considered him a friend. That soft crunching sound you heard was the supposedly hard-charging New Jersey governor walking on eggshells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rand Paul claims the desire and ability to expand the party's reach to more minorities. So where's his takedown of Trump?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bush has said that a politician must be willing to lose the party's nomination in order to win the general election, but that philosophy can't end with his allegiance to the Common Core. It has to include an unblinking acknowledgment of his party's craziness whenever and wherever it flares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trump's hold on voters stems largely from his lack of any filter and from his directness, traits that they don't see in establishment candidates. So his fellow Republicans' filtered, indirect approach to him just gives him more power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while he should be irrelevant, he's becoming ever more relevant, because he's exposing their timidity and caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They're wrong to try to ignore him, because the media won't do that and because he's probably going to qualify for the debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Looking ahead to the first of them, the conservative pundit George Will bought into the notion of Trump as an ineradicable pest who ''says something hideously inflammatory, which is all he knows how to say, and then what do the other nine people onstage do?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Oh, please. That's hardly an existential crisis. It's a prompt for an overdue smidgen of valor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Without any hesitation, they tell him that he's a disgrace. Without any hedging, they tell him that he's absurd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's the truth. And for the Republican Party, it might just be transformative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;There are some Republicans rejoicing and strongly supporting in Donald J. Trump&amp;#8217;s comments about Mexicans, including the conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump's views on immigration have drawn bipartisan condemnation but his surprisingly strong poll numbers are evidence that he is touching a nerve with a subset of the Republican party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voice of that support can be heard loudly clearly on&nbsp;conservative radio and through commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Limbaugh has devoted substantial air time to Mr. Trump in recent days, praising him for refusing to apologize for calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminal despite widespread protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people would have buckled long ago,&quot; Mr. Limbaugh said on his radio show this week. &quot;Most people would have cried uncle and begged forgiveness of the new totalitarians long ago. I have an incredible amount of admiration and respect for just this aspect of what Trump has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump's views appear to resonate with at least some of Mr. Limbaugh's audience. One caller said that the billionaire businessman's views have made him a supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I heard his speech in which he talked about the illegals and there being criminals and murderers and I told my wife right then, 'What he's saying is what everybody I work with believes,' &quot; said Chester from San Diego. &quot;I'd vote for him right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Coulter told Laura Ingraham on her radio show on Wednesday that Republicans were being unfair by ganging up on Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is really striking a chord, and I think all these Republican politicians who came out and attacked him are going to have to take it back,&quot; Ms. Coulter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Change.org petitions have been instrumental in pressuring companies to sever their business ties with Mr. Trump, he also has his share of supporters. A spokesman for Change.org said that about 15 percent of the Trump-related petitions on its website back him, the most popular being &quot;Support Donald&nbsp;Trump Against Illegal Immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump's Facebook pageis also proving to be fertile ground for&nbsp;support, with his posts gathering thousands of comments from people cheering him on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about time someone tells it like it is!&quot; wrote Maggie Haren. &quot;The libs hate this because the Obama Sheeple are not supposed to be hearing this stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump, who said that he has a good relationship with Mexicans despite his inflammatory remarks, even appears to have the backing of&nbsp;some immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a legal Mexican living here in the U.S. I'm a college student in Chicago,&quot; wrote Arturo Chavez. &quot;I like your honesty. Mr. Trump let's make American great again, but not everyone is criminal and rapists.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump insisted on Thursday that his phone call with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was brief and described he it as &quot;congratulatory&quot; instead of condemnatory, in contrast to news accounts of the talk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is shocking,&quot; Mr. Trump, the real-estate mogul who is now running for president as a Republican, of descriptions of his conversation with Mr. Priebus on Wednesday that portrayed it as lasting nearly an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The call last for 10 minutes - maximum, maximum 15 minutes,&quot; Mr. Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Priebus, he said, &quot;knows better than to lecture me.&quot; He added, &quot;We're not dealing with a five-star Army general.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump did not dispute that at some point in the brief call, Mr. Priebus asked him to soften his rhetoric, which has included some caustic remarks about Mexicans, and which has some party leaders deeply concerned in terms of the lingering effect the comments could have on the party's chances of ultimate success in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump's negative ratings in polls are high, but in terms of horse race numbers, he is doing well in early surveys, running in second place in New Hampshire. The early national polls will help determine who makes it onstage at next month's Fox News debate in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Priebus &quot;said wow, you're really doing well in the polls, you really hit a nerve,&quot; Mr. Trump described the chairman as saying. Mr. Priebus added, according to Mr. Trump, &quot;It could be that you'll be number one in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'Well, you really have hit a nerve, keep going,'&quot; Mr. Trump recalled. &quot;He said, 'If you could tone it down - I know that's tough - but if you could tone it down, that wouldn't be bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real estate mogul and TV personality said his aides have been in touch with Mr. Priebus frequently in recent weeks, but that no concern had ever been expressed about Mr. Trump's comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was more of a congratulatory call,&quot; Mr. Trump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Mr. Priebus, declined to comment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Many readers say Mr. Trump has exposed a &amp;#8220;Republican id&amp;#8221; of racism and xenophobia, but others appreciate his plain-speaking style. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump, many readers say, has exposed a &quot;Republican id&quot; of racism and xenophobia that has long succeeded for the party as an implied message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They argue that Mr. Trump's frank appeals to the lowest common denominators in the electorate have left the Republican Party faced with its own lowest common denominator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans' Trump problem is that he expresses openly the virulent, bigoted position of the party when it comes to immigration,&quot; Paul wrote from Long Island. &quot;He is the modern day Bull Connor waving the verbal truncheon of intolerance for all to see.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Bruni described the New York businessman as a &quot;bully and bigot&quot; who has lent &quot;his huff and his hair&quot; to the Republican presidential primary contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G.O.P., Mr. Bruni said, should regard Mr. Trump's xenophobic portrayals of Mexican immigrants as an opportunity to reclaim the political high ground from extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many readers responded with the argument that Mr. Trump is a creature of the Republican Party's own making, given the history of its Southern strategy in presidential elections and inclusion of racists in its ranks and among its funders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans can't denounce Trump because they have been riding those same dark horses of the lunatic fringe,&quot; THector in Alexandria wrote. &quot;Maybe in a somewhat less directly offensive way, but spouting the same sickening meanings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Mr. Trump's admirers wrote in, too. Several shared their appreciation for Mr. Trump's plain-speaking style, and said they welcomed his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump is a breath of fresh air simultaneously exposing the hypocrisy of the liberal media and telling it like it is on the issue of illegal immigration,&quot; Jacob Handelsman wrote from Houston. &quot;Trump is a true American patriot and those Americans not brainwashed by politically correct ideology recognize this and have vaulted him into the lead of several polls of Republican voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some said that despite his faults, Mr. Trump's views on immigration raise a question in many voters' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump, at least, has the guts to say what he believes, unlike almost all the others, both Democrats and Republicans,&quot; Mike Barker wrote from Arizona. &quot;No other candidate has told us exactly why the United States needs to allow millions of low-skilled immigrants into our country when there are more than 90 million unemployed Americans who have given up looking for jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing writer Peter Wehner, an official in the last three Republican administrations, described Mr. Trump as &quot;witless,&quot; &quot;crude,&quot; and &nbsp;&quot;operating on his own fantasy island.&quot; He urged Republicans to distance the party from Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If conservatives rally to defend Mr. Trump on the grounds that he's 'refreshing' and has 'passion,' that he's 'anti-establishment' and irritates liberals, they will do considerable damage to their movement and to the Republican Party,&quot; Mr. Wehner wrote. &quot;We're the ones who have the most to lose from a successful Trump candidacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some readers seemed to delight in Mr. Trump, the caricature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Trump should have his speech writers viewing old episodes of 'All In the Family' for issues and policy guidance,&quot; Harry Pope wrote from Austin, Tex. &quot;The ghost of Archie Bunker with a golden mane is on the ramparts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynn in Greenville, S.C., was one of several readers who encouraged Mr. Trump's candidacy as a method to weaken the Republican ticket. &quot;I'd love to see that bombastic windbag debate Hillary or Bernie,&quot; she wrote. &quot;If it's possible to die from laughing too hard, I expect I might.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As ever, readers offered artistic and literary insight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a style of art called trompe l'oeil where something is painted to appear the real thing, but the substance does not exist at all,&quot; Robert Demko wrote from Crestone, Colo. &quot;How appropriate Mr. Trump's name is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One even made reference to Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've read this story. Doctor creates a monster that destroys them both in the end,&quot; Occupy Government wrote from Oakland. &quot;The G.O.P. promoted their mean-spirited base with fear-mongering and race-baiting and immigrant-bashing and now, the monster is driving the bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three navigation coordination points above Palm Beach International Airport that had been named in honor of Donald J. Trump will be renamed, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In general, the F.A.A. chooses names that are noncontroversial,'' said an agency spokeswoman, Laura Brown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A growing number of businesses have been severing ties with Mr. Trump since the Republican presidential candidate made derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants in a campaign speech. That includes NBC, which aired Mr. Trump's show, ''The Apprentice.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2010, an air traffic controller who was a fan of Mr. Trump's reality show and its catchphrase, ''You're fired,'' named some of the navigation points that pilots use for takeoff from the airport DONLD, TRMMP and UFIRD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the time, Mr. Trump told a reporter with The Palm Beach Post that he was flattered, but Thursday morning, he issued a statement that said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  '''Making America Great Again' is far more important to me than an honor I never knew I had ... meaning a blip on the radar,'' he said in a statement released by Michael D. Cohen,executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other navigation points were named IVNKA ONE, in honor of Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and BUFIT ONE, after the singer Jimmy Buffett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Brown said she wasn't sure if IVNKA ONE would be renamed as well, but said that nothing would happen immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Because of the charting cycle, the updates could take several months to take effect,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The coordinate names are used for a type of instrument area navigation, called RNAV. The points entered into the computer should be five letters long and must be unique to that airport. Ideally, they relate to the area where the coordinates are located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump has had a long history with the area, where his daughter, Tiffany, was born in 1993. He purchased Mar-a-Lago, an estate built in the 1920s for Marjorie Merriweather Post, in 1985. After renovating it, Mr. Trump opened the estate in 1995 as a private club, though he still maintains a residence there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has sued the county repeatedly over the flight noise around the property. In January, he filed a $100 million lawsuit against Palm Beach County, contending that his ongoing conflict with the airport led officials to retaliate by routing all flights directly over his estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A 2010 lawsuit was dismissed. A 1995 lawsuit over the noise ended with the county agreeing to lease Mr. Trump the land where he later built Trump International Golf Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not uncommon to name flight coordinates after celebrities, real or imaginary. In Orlando, Fla., there are a GOOFY, MINEE, PIGLT and BUGGZ. The flight paths into San Francisco are named with Grateful Dead references, including DEDHD, GRTFL, HYPEE, COSMC, TYDYE and TRUKN. But from the get-go, some pilots were unhappy about honoring Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paul Agnew, who was then head of the airport's advisory committee on noise, was quoted in The Palm Beach Post saying that some pilots were unhappy with the decision to honor Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We actually have had reports of people refusing to fly these departures because they are so offended by the fact that Trump has been memorialized,'' Mr. Agnew told the airport's advisory committee during a 2010 meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The flight controller who suggested the names, Gregory Gish, has since retired, the paper reported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO --  It is not often that rhetoric from a political candidate finds its way into the sporting arena, but the recent remarks about immigration by the presidential candidate Donald Trump have caused the P.G.A. of America to remove a tournament from one of the golf courses he operates and prompted ESPN and Nascar to remove award events from Trump's properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Mexico's national soccer team opened the Concacaf Gold Cup against Cuba here Thursday, Trump's assertion that Mexicans coming to the United States were drug traffickers, rapists and other criminals -- ''some, I assume, are good people,'' he allowed -- did not go unnoticed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no sign of an organized protest, either around Soldier Field or in nearby Grant Park, where thousands of fans paraded in the late afternoon, but there were signs. One carried a message to Trump: ''Estamos aqu&iacute;'' (We are here). Another declared the stadium a no-Trump zone. During the game, fans broke into a profane chant in Spanish directed toward Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What he said bothered me,'' said Caesar Camarena, an immigrant who works as a waiter in Aurora, Ill., and was attending the game with his son and a group of friends. ''We love the U.S.A.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were among the stream of Mexico fans who took photos in front of the Spirit of the American Doughboy statue that stands inside the south entrance to Soldier Field in front of a large American flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  El Tricolor, as Mexico's team is known, is a great source of pride because many of its best players carve out careers in Europe's best leagues. But the team's mercurial performances -- barely qualifying for last summer's World Cup ahead of Panama and New Zealand, then nearly beating powers like Brazil and the Netherlands once it did qualify -- also make it a source of angst. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, it did not matter that Cuba, already a weak opponent, had lost one of its best players, striker Keiler Garc&iacute;a, who defected Wednesday. Cuba was also without six other players and Coach Ra&uacute;l Gonz&aacute;lez Triana, who did not arrive because of what an official called ''logistical problems.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mexico's 6-0 victory, which could have been even more decisive, was a cause for celebration. The crowd, announced at 54,126, groaned after the near misses, such as when Carlos Vela twice rattled the goal posts, and cheered each goal as if it were a World Cup winner, waving flags and tossing cups of beer in the air. The final minutes elapsed with toilet paper rolls and smoke bombs raining onto the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tournament is critical for Mexico, which saved its best players for the Gold Cup rather than the more prestigious Copa Am&eacute;rica, which concluded with Chile's win on July 4. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though Mexico's roster features international stars, such as Vela, who has returned to the national team after a three-year hiatus, and the 2012 Olympics hero Oribe Peralta, who had a hat trick against Cuba, it will have to do without two of its best: forward Javier Hern&aacute;ndez and defender H&eacute;ctor Moreno, who were injured before the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mexico does not win the Gold Cup, which determines the regional champion of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean, it will be shut out of the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, a tournament that is a prelude to the 2018 World Cup, which Russia will also host. Not only is the Confederations Cup a chance to scout logistics and acclimate to field conditions, it is an opportunity to play against the best teams in each region of the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mexico wins the Gold Cup, it will be in a playoff later this year at a site to be determined against the United States, the 2013 Gold Cup winner, to determine the Confederations Cup entrant for Concacaf, the regional governing body that oversees soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Confederations Cup is a really important tournament for us,'' Mexico midfielder Miguel Lay&uacute;n said. ''It gives us a chance to play before a World Cup, to be ready in a better way. Also, you have a good chance to keep raising your hand that you are here in the confederation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As singular as the players' focus may be, Lay&uacute;n said that they could not escape the uproar that Trump's comments had caused, either in Mexico or here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's really hard to talk about that because we have a lot of people working here, a lot of Mexicans trying to keep going and improve themselves in their life,'' he said. ''I prefer not to talk about him. He doesn't deserve my time or my words.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trump's comments surely hit home for Mexico's reserve goalkeeper, Mois&eacute;s Mu&ntilde;oz, who spent his elementary and middle school years in Northern California as the undocumented son of migrant workers. His parents, who have resident status, live in San Jose, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We can't get involved in any political stuff,'' he said. ''Even if it's a subject back in Mexico that's something to do with our politics in Mexico, we can't say anything about it. It would be a mistake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mexico next faces Guatemala in Glendale, Ariz., on Sunday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For anyone in New York shopping for a Trump Collection silk tie and matching shirt, or Empire and Success colognes, about the only place left to find such billionaire memorabilia is on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Not in a department store, though, but in the lobby of Trump Tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, just past the bronze-and-obsidian-glass doors, is a pair of mahogany counters making up the Trump Store. They are not far from the spot where Donald J. Trump announced his presidential campaign last month -- and lost many of his business partnerships as a result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But here, on Mr. Trump's marble doorstep, the $15 ''Make America Great Again'' T-shirts and box sets of ''The Apprentice'' should not be available, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those gilded goods are being sold in a passageway that is meant to be public space, the mahogany counters supplanting a marble bench that was mandated there. The golden three-foot-high Trump Tower sign may be the first thing visitors notice, but just beneath it are the words ''Open to the Public 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What was promised as a pedestrian causeway in crowded Midtown Manhattan now more resembles an altar to Mr. Trump, one that New York City officials have struggled for a decade to dislodge. Now that he is vying for the Republican nomination, public-space advocates are hoping all the attention might help resolve their territorial dispute with Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a New York peculiarity that an atrium lined with golden mirrors, Gucci logos and an 80-foot waterfall would qualify as a public amenity. Yet there are privately owned public spaces, colloquially known as POPS, dotting Manhattan and a sliver of Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the six-story Trump Atrium opened in 1983, the New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger declared it ''warm, luxurious and even exhilarating.'' It draws more than one million visitors annually from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's on my list of places I always wanted to visit, along with all the museums and other cultural landmarks,'' Anna Cherkeszishvili, a Seton Hall graduate student from the former Soviet republic of Georgia, said as she took in the glittering sights from the escalator last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She was enjoying an unusual byproduct of the city's postwar boom. As the streets filled with new skyscrapers and an influx of people, the city sought to create more space for both. Starting in 1961, if developers agreed to include some public amenities on their properties, they were permitted to create bigger buildings. The most famous of these public spaces is arguably Zuccotti Park, thanks to the Occupy Wall Street movement, though POPS exist in an array of buildings, including the Henri Bendel store and the MetroTech Center in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the case of Trump Tower, the developer, working on his first signature project, was able to add about 20 floors to the 66-story tower -- nearly a third of its total height -- in exchange for building public spaces and shops in the atrium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This meant dozens of extra condominiums worth millions to their builder. A triplex penthouse went for a then-astronomical $12 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the gain was not only Mr. Trump's. A special zoning guideline sets specifics for the space, down to the number of trees and locations of seating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Between the Trump Grill and the Trump Caf&eacute; on the concourse level are plush tables and chairs open to all, whether or not visitors buy an $8 ham and cheese sandwich. A couple of landscaped terraces are tucked away on the fourth and fifth floors, accessible via the mirrored escalators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was also a black marble bench a few feet from the entrance, a popular destination for Fifth Avenue shoppers and workers to relax. Sometime in the last decade -- there are no records of exactly when -- the bench was replaced with one of the two Trump shopping counters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Buildings Department could find no permits for the work; permission was not granted by the Department of City Planning to alter the regulations for the public space. The Trump Organization was fined $2,500 for the violation in 2008, but there has been no further action, and the violation remains open and unresolved. A Buildings Department spokesman said recourse was limited because the space presented no public hazard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael Cohen, an executive vice president at the Trump Organization, said all work had been done appropriately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everything regarding Trump Tower has been done correctly, legally and in full compliance of law,'' he said. ''To assert that Donald&nbsp;Trump did construction on the iconic Trump Tower building without the required permits is ludicrous.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bench has been contested territory from the beginning. Shortly after the building opened, the bench was covered with large planters that prevented anyone from sitting there. City officials quickly notified Mr. Trump of the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His response was typically direct. ''We have had tremendous difficulties with respect to the bench -- drug addicts, vagrants, et cetera have come to the atrium in large numbers,'' Mr. Trump wrote in an April 16, 1984, letter on file with the City Planning Department. ''Additionally, all sorts of 'horrors' had been taking place that effectively ruined the beautiful ambience of the space which everyone loves so much.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Philip Schneider, a former senior planner with the department, handled what Mr. Trump referred to as ''the bench problem.'' He was surprised when the developer showed up himself, rather than sending his architect or lawyer to address the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The problem always is, a deal is a deal, and once the developer gets what they want, how do you ensure the public still gets what was promised?'' Mr. Schneider said. ''He said it was better, but his idea of an improvement may not be the same as everybody else's.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An agreement was reached the next year and the bench was restored, offering respite for at least two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If a few feet of marble seems trivial in a city of thousand-foot towers and millions of people, it is precisely because of all that crowding that POPS can receive so much scrutiny. For Jerold Kayden, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Design and the author of ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience,'' such encroachments are what break down the city's civic bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It may seem insignificant, but that bench was a beacon to people that this was an open, welcoming space,'' Mr. Kayden, who founded the Advocates for Privately Owned Public Space, said during a tour of the space last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, visitors are welcomed by Mr. Trump's face, smiling from the covers of his books.</SPAN></P>

Jeb Bush of Florida, one day after officially announcing that he was running for president, was by turns serious and playful in an extensive interview in New Hampshire with Fox News. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DERRY, N.H. - Jeb Bush said Tuesday that the enhanced interrogation techniques deployed by his brother after Sept. 11 attacks were no longer appropriate, that he hoped the Supreme Court would rule against same-sex marriage, and mocked Hillary Rodham Clinton for passing few laws during her eight years in the Senate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an extensive interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush was by turns serious and playful, at one point audibly chuckling at criticism from Donald Trump, who is now running for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mr. Bush said of his laughter. But he did not seem sorry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fox interview will be broadcast on Tuesday night, but it could be overheard by reporters standing nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed on the same-sex marriage case before the Supreme Court, Mr. Bush said: &quot;I believe in traditional marriage. I hope the Supreme Court rules that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the country should not discriminate against any American based on sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush, a two-term governor of Florida, was in New Hampshire for a town hall-style meeting a day after officially announcing his presidential candidacy in Miami. He repeatedly rebuked Mrs. Clinton, his biggest Democratic rival, in Tuesday's interview. He called her record in Libya, where terrorists killed the American ambassador, &quot;a complete failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recounting her legislative accomplishments, Mr. Bush said of his work in Florida, &quot;I put that record up against Hillary Clinton's any day of the week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he offered words of praise, as well, calling Mrs. Clinton &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush offered brief and sometimes tart descriptions about some of his Republican rivals in the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Real Texan,&quot; he said of Gov. Rick Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fighter,&quot; he said of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good morning on this crystalline Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Legislature's session is scheduled to wrap up today (barring the need for overtime), and it's been a dramatic one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drama has not come from the legislation but from the indictments of Sheldon Silver, the former State Assembly speaker, and of Dean G. Skelos, the majority leader of the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the lawmaking front, things have been relatively quiet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the usual flurry of last-minute activity on Tuesday: Legislators moved forward on &quot;yes means yes&quot; campus sexual assault laws. And they approved measures to make medical marijuana available to some critically ill patients and to let dogs eat with owners at outdoor restaurant tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is still no deal on the rent-control laws that cover about a million apartments in the city and its suburbs, which expired on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other unresolved matters include a law that gives tax credits for building affordable housing and an education tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susanne Craig, The Times's bureau chief in Albany, blamed the slowdown on the forced departure of two of the &quot;three men in a room&quot; who generally hammer out political deals (the third being Governor Cuomo).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really changed the dynamic,&quot; she told us, &quot;because the governor hasn't negotiated before&quot; with Carl E. Heastie, the new State Assembly speaker, or with John J. Flanagan, the even-newer Senate leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, Ms. Craig added, given the federal prosecutor Preet Bharara's relentless pursuit of political corruption, &quot;A lot of people are now questioning the way they were doing business,&quot; in Albany, &quot;and whether it would be viewed as illegal under a new prism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what else is happening: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEATHER </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preternaturally pleasant: mostly sunny and dry, with a high of 78.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch for pollen, though: The forecast level is very high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And beware of thickening clouds on Thursday, as showers head this way again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first 200 years or so of European settlement, Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor was a smallpox quarantine station, a vacation haven, and a fort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 17, 1885, the island found a new purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Is&egrave;re, a French steamship, sailed into the harbor bearing the many-ton copper segments that would come together in the form of the Statue of Liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An account in The Times a few days later described the extreme pomp that greeted the vessel and its cargo as the harbor jammed with boats filled with crowds jostling for a glimpse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every lady was waving a parasol or a handkerchief,&quot; The Times reported, &quot;gentlemen were flourishing hats and canes, and the whole was a sight that New-York Bay has never witnessed before and will probably never witness again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bedloe's Island was eventually renamed Liberty Island, but the star-shaped fort stayed: Its walls became the statue's base.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul did well from mid-May to mid-June in their likes, posts, comments and shares, according to interaction figures released by Facebook. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If elections were won based on Facebook chatter, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Rand Paul would be the front-runners in early primary season states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media company has released figures on how the candidates - and presumed candidates - fared in terms of Facebook interactions in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina from mid-May to mid-June. Interactions represent likes, posts, comments and shares about a candidate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton is leading all candidates in the three states, and is generating the most interest in South Carolina, where she has 460,000 interactions from 104,000 people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sanders, the independent from Vermont running for the Democratic nomination, trails Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, but leads all the other Republicans in those states. Mr. Sanders, a socialist who rails against the influence of corporate money in politics, has an enthusiastic cadre of followers on Facebook and Twitter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paul, who has also invested in a sophisticated social media strategy and likes to &quot;troll&quot; his opponents online, comes in third place in Iowa and New Hampshire, after Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. He is doing even better in South Carolina, where he is in second place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Gov. Jeb Bush, of Florida has some ground to make up on the Facebook front. He ranks fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire (following Senator Ted Cruz of Texas) and seventh in South Carolina. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media dynamics in South Carolina are somewhat different than Iowa and New Hampshire, as Senator Lindsey Graham, who hails from the state, is generating more discussion there and Ben Carson ranks third. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some White House hopefuls such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has yet to declare, have landed in the middle of the pack despite national polls that label them as &quot;top tier&quot; candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But social media chatter is no substitute for formal surveys, as interest in a candidate, such as Donald Trump, can overshadow how seriously voters take them as a potential president. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WEEK of absurdity around a confused racial con artist, and a massacre in a black church brings us to this: Today is the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth, when the last of the American slaves were told they were free. Now, to put it to good use, at a time when a post-racial era seems very much out of reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first black man to live in the White House, long hesitant about doing anything bold on the color divide, could make one of the most simple and dramatic moves of his presidency: apologize for the land of the free being, at one time, the largest slaveholding nation on earth. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Confederate flag that still flies on the grounds of the Statehouse in South Carolina, cradle of the Civil War, is a reminder that the hatred behind the proclaimed right to own another human being has never left our shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An apology would not kill that hatred, but it would ripple, positively, in ways that may be felt for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the son of a Kenyan father and a white mother who died more than a century after slavery ended, Barack Obama has little ancestral baggage on this issue. Yet no man could make a stronger statement about America's original sin than the first African-American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservatives would caw -- they always do -- and say, get over it, don't play the race card. Liberals would complain that a simple apology did not go far enough, unless it entailed reparations for the descendants of slaves. But words of contrition -- a formal acknowledgment of a grievous wrong by a great nation -- have a power all their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The British, the Vatican, the Germans and the South Africans have all issued formal apologies for their official cruelties, and each case has had a cleansing, even liberating effect. The United States Congress apologized to African-Americans for slavery in 2009, though it came with a caveat that the mea culpa could not be used as legal rationale for reparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And President Bill Clinton, while in Africa in 1998, apologized for the slave trade, but not for a government that institutionalized white supremacy during its first four score and change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For this year's Juneteenth -- commemorating the day in 1865, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, when a Union general landed in Galveston, Tex., and told the last of the dead-enders in Texas that ''all slaves are free'' -- President Obama could close a loop in a terrible history. He could also elevate the current discussion on race, which swirled earlier this week around the serial liar Rachel Dolezal, and the race-baiting billionaire vanity blimp of Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The slaughter of worshipers in a church with long ties to fighting slavery and Jim Crow ''raises questions about a dark part of our history,'' President Obama said Thursday. Questions about why South Carolina can still fly the flag of a traitor nation, a flag apparently embraced by the shooter. Questions rooted in a history that calls for a formal apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the time the first Africans arrived as slaves in Jamestown in 1619 through the codification of blacks as three-fifths of a person in the Constitution and up to the eve of the Civil War, when four million people were held in bondage, slavery has been the most incongruent element of a people proclaiming to be enlightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lincoln said he hated ''the monstrous injustice of slavery,'' in part because it allowed ''enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Countries, religions and corporations sometimes do awful things in their names. It doesn't diminish them to note their failures, their injustices, their crimes against humanity. It elevates them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain apologized to the Irish in 1997 for England's role in a famine that killed more than a million people, it opened the door to reconciliation, and a burst of new scholarship and awareness about a genocidal episode long mired in shame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The British government also tried to make good for prosecuting a World War II hero and Nazi code breaker, Alan Turing, for the crime of being gay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It took the Vatican 350 years to apologize for the persecution of the Italian astronomer Galileo. But now the church speaks with authority, backed by science, on climate change -- leaving Republicans in the United States in the dungeon of ignorance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pope John Paul II apologized to Jews for the Vatican's inaction on the Holocaust and to Muslims killed by crusaders. Last year, Pope Francis reached out to victims of clerical sex abuse and said he was sorry on behalf of the church he leads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Ronald Reagan signed legislation that provided payments and apologies for the internment, during World War II, of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans -- most of them United States citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's harder to be contrite than to conquer. Obama had nothing to do with slavery. Most Americans, descendants of immigrants shunned in their homelands, have very little connection to the slaveholders of the American South. So why apologize? Because we own this past. As such, we have to condemn it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poems, greetings and grumblings then get posted online, forming a sort of linguistic chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are divulgences (&quot;Sometimes I drink to get high, but usually I drink to get by&quot;) and declarations of love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are philosophical quandaries (&quot;What is a question? Was that a rhetorical question?&quot;) and lyrical poems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In late 2011, during the planning for one of the debates of Republican presidential candidates, questions were raised about whether the eight-person field would be too unwieldy for television. One suggestion was to drop the low man in the polls, former Senator Rick Santorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the idea was rejected and the debate was a success. Mr. Santorum went on to win the Iowa caucuses and was the runner-up to Mitt Romney for the nomination. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a useful reminder as the crazy-quilt plans for Republican, and perhaps Democratic, debates start to take shape. The Republican National Committee is trying to take control of the debates of party candidates, and wants its say on the participating journalists and some ground rules. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first nationally televised forum of Republican contenders would be a travesty if, as is very possible, it included Donald Trump and excluded serious but lower-polling politicians such as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Republican National Committee, reasoning that a surfeit of primary debates hurt Mr. Romney in the last general election, moved to designate nine official debates (so far) at specific times and places, and warned candidates against participating in any others. The Democratic National Committee has called for six debates -- predictably, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont wants more -- without providing the specifics of time and place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not the seemingly endless number of debates that cost Mr. Romney the presidency; four years earlier, Barack Obama took part in almost as many forums against a much more formidable field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Republican nominee lost, despite mediocre conditions in the country, because of his own political inadequacies -- remember his idea for self-deportation of undocumented immigrants and his gaffe about the 47 percent of non-tax-paying loafers. In addition, the Obama campaign was infinitely better than Mr. Romney's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The effect of debates is exaggerated. They usually don't change the outcome or the basics of a race; often they provide merely predictable posturing and familiar sound bites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But they are still necessary and useful, especially to weed out the unqualified or unready, like the pizza executive Herman Cain and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas in 2012. But the parties should not dictate conditions and terms of debates. They should rely on the marketplace, which Republicans say they revere, minimize the role of journalists or intermediaries and place a premium on getting candidates to question one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sponsors of the first two Republican debates, Fox News and CNN, understandably worry about a huge field of at least 14 candidates, possibly 16, by later this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But both networks are making it worse. They propose an A-team debate with 10 (CNN says maybe eight) candidates who score the highest in the average of the five most recent national polls. The remainder would form the  B-team, who would debate separately. This ignores a history of candidates who barely register six months before the initial contests where they do well. And this sets false standards: A candidate, with, say, a 4.4 percent standing in the latest surveys, is serious, while one with 4.2 percent belongs at the kiddie table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Newt Gingrich, an unsuccessful candidate last time, criticized this approach, offering an interesting suggestion: The also-rans should be allowed to comment on social media throughout the debate on the A-team's answers. Imagine Mr. Trump in that venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the best idea was offered by top New Hampshire Republicans who said the CNN and Fox formats would be ''unnecessarily narrow and risks eliminating potentially viable candidates based on unreliable national polling that is rarely predictive of primary election outcomes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, they proposed staging two equal debates with seven or eight candidates apiece; take the top six politicians in the polls and put three in each forum, then randomly assign the others. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A poll of New Hampshire voters shows Jeb Bush leading the candidates for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, with Donald J. Trump a surprising second. Mr. Bush is not doing nearly as well in Iowa polls. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeb Bush, who is struggling in the polls in Iowa, may find his salvation in New Hampshire. Yet another poll of New Hampshire voters shows him leading the passel of nearly 20 Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential nomination. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida who has family ties to New England, was backed by 14 percent of respondents in a Suffolk University poll released Tuesday; the surprise was that his nearest competitor was Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul-TV personality who announced his candidacy last week and who captured the support of nearly 11 percent of those surveyed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That put him ahead of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who placed third with 8 percent, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had less than 7 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Iowa, Mr. Walker has dominated the polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com. There, polls show Mr. Bush running from third to fifth place, far back enough to prompt speculation that his campaign may skip Iowa and move his chips to New Hampshire, which is shaping up as his make-or-break state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush has been ahead in most other recent polls in New Hampshire, where Mr. Walker, Mr. Rubio and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky had been in a scramble for second, third and fourth place before Mr. Trump unsettled the waters. In this poll, Mr. Paul slipped to seventh place, with 4 percent support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump's surprising strength could reflect a protest vote and dissatisfaction with the other candidates. The Suffolk poll showed him with a lower favorable rating and higher unfavorable rating than any other Republican, which makes his second-place showing somewhat dubious even as it may temporarily embarrass his rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are two types of contenders in New Hampshire - those that are widely popular and have good upside potential like Rubio, Bush and Walker,&quot; said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston. &quot;Then you have contenders who have high unfavorabilities but still have a loyal niche of voters supporting them.&quot; He put Mr. Trump in this category. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the short run, these candidates are competitive with the more popular G.O.P. contenders,&quot; he said. &quot;But in the long run it will be harder to grow as the field of candidates is reduced and the negatives become a disqualifier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll questioned 500 likely Republican primary voters from June 18 to 22, and it had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump's business empire was dealt its first casualty Thursday as a result of his decision to run for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Univision said that it was ending its relationship with the Trump Organization, that it will not air the Miss USA pageant on its network next month, and that it is severing ties with the  Miss Universe Organization. Mr. Trump is a part owner of the Miss Universe Organization, the umbrella group for both the United States and world beauty pageants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Univision said the decision was because of Mr. Trump's recent remarks about Mexican immigrants. During his presidential announcement last week, Mr. Trump proposed building a wall along the border to keep criminals and &quot;rapists&quot; from sneaking into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Univision, we see firsthand the work ethic, love for family, strong religious values and the important role Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans have had and will continue to have in building the future of our country,&quot; the company said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump said in a statement that Univision was breaking a contract because of pressure from the Mexican government. He also vowed not to be silenced on the subject, arguing that the United States was being damaged by costly trade deals with Mexico and an influx of illegal immigrants who are taking American jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have great respect for Mexico and love the Mexican people, but my loyalty is to the United States and making our country great again,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a subsequentinterview with Politico, Mr. Trump suggested that former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida would have apologized for angering the Mexican government with such blunt remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone else would be subservient to that,&quot; Mr. Trump said. &quot;Bush would say, I'm sorry, keep ripping us off.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jab at Mr. Bush comes as a poll this week showed Mr. Trump trailing him by a small margin in New Hampshire, the first primary state. </SPAN></P>

Trump would have announced for president last week: a softer, humbler version of &amp;#8220;the Donald,&amp;#8221; with a common touch. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Fred Davis's imagination, a whole new Donald J. Trump would have announced for president last week: a softer, humbler version of &quot;the Donald,&quot; with a common touch and a demeanor far removed from (in Mr. Davis's words) the &quot;proudly egotistical showman&quot; of reality television fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis, a top adviser and creative director to Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and known for his arresting television commercials, laid out his vision for overhauling Mr. Trump in a three-page memo last month to the real estate mogul's campaign manager.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No braggadocio, no 757s or helicopters (as much as I love them), a different Mr. Trump would be portrayed,&quot; Mr. Davis wrote. &quot;Remember this morning when you said he was really 'down to earth'? Right now that is simply unbelievable, it would be my job to make it believable and authentic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That pitch was as far as things went: Mr. Davis now advises Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, another likely Republican presidential candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mr. Trump's campaign kickoff last week, he eschewed humility entirely, announcing that he was &quot;really rich&quot; and estimating his net worth at nearly $9 billion, and offending Hispanics by saying that Mexican immigration means more crime, drugs and rapists in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Mr. Davis confirmed that he had met with Trump advisers - as well as a &quot;super PAC&quot; supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas - after his longtime client, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, announced he would not run for president. But Mr. Davis's proposal for a toned-down Mr. Trump never gained traction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never met or talked to Trump, but somebody over there didn't seem to agree,&quot; Mr. Davis said. &quot;My guess is that it was the Donald, but I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least superficially, Mr. Davis and Mr. Trump might have seemed an intriguing match: Mr. Davis is known for producing quirky and creative ads, which often garner intense attention online and in the political press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, described Mr. Davis as &quot;one of the best in the business,&quot; but said the campaign planned to take its own distinctive approach to advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've talked to a number of firms, but Mr. Trump, because of his success in business - he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, he's doing O.K. - he wants to do things a little differently,&quot; Mr. Lewandowski said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his memo, Mr. Davis proposed an extensive - and presumably costly - media campaign, including immediate advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire, and on national cable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I envision something beautiful and elegant, not like any political ad ever, with minimal visuals of Mr. T. Instead it would feature a lot of people across the country talking about finally needing this place to work,&quot; Mr. Davis wrote, adding of Mr. Trump, &quot;He is present in the film in an understated way, causing people to think, 'maybe I was wrong about that man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flashing enthusiasm, Mr. Davis added: &quot;This is a very exciting project. Almost life-defining, if you'll pardon a touch of hubris.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wow, Supreme Court -- what a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Supreme Court just upheld Obamacare yet again,'' said Jeb Bush in a fund-raising shout-out. ''This is the direct result of President Obama. He deliberately forced Obamacare on the American people in a partisan and toxic way.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whoever actually wrote Bush's email did a brilliant job since it, a) manages to blame Barack Obama for a Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees, and b) does sort of sound like the way Jeb Bush talks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ever-growing throng of Republican candidates for president were all in a fury over the Obamacare decision, but they divided a bit on gay marriage. Bush took the more moderate road, which involved trying to sound sad and then change the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once again, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee led the field in howling, demanding that the people ''resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat.'' Once again we will contemplate the fact that Huckabee used to be known as the tenderhearted Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald Trump blamed Jeb Bush for the court's gay rights decision, which is even more creative than Jeb Bush blaming Barack Obama for the one on health care. I believe Trump's early line of reasoning goes like this: Jeb Bush as Florida governor helped get his brother the presidency during the Bush-Gore recounts; George Bush then nominated John Roberts to head the Supreme Court, and even though Roberts was on the dissenting side of the gay marriage decision, still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or it could have been something completely different. Really, it's beside the point. Forget I ever brought it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The only alternative left for the American people is to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reaffirm the ability of the states to continue to define marriage,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. There were a lot of calls for a constitutional amendment, which will happen at approximately the same time hell freezes over. The last time the nation managed to rally together and change the Constitution was in 1992, when the people looked deep into their hearts and decided to join hands and prohibit a Congress from raising its own salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Roberts Supreme Court is on a roll. Gay marriage, national health care and a surprising vote of support for the Fair Housing Act, all in a couple of days. Great job, guys! We are totally over the fact that you destroyed the nation's campaign finance laws, limited workers' rights to challenge wage discrimination and women's rights to control their bodies. And basically disemboweled a 50-year-old Voting Rights Act that Congress had renewed by increasingly large margins on four different occasions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stop. Trying to be nothing but positive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everybody will remember this week for the gay marriage decision, but let's talk about the Obamacare ruling. The court decided -- in what opponents decried as a wild leap of judgment -- that it was not going to strip millions of people of their health coverage and upend one of the most important pieces of legislation in modern history because of a four-word drafting error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Affordable Care Act has now been upheld twice by the Supreme Court. The American people, for their part, voted in 2008 to elect a president who promised to create a national right to health insurance coverage, and voted in 2012 to re-elect him over a candidate who promised to undo it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all that, not to mention about 60 failed attempts to repeal the act in Congress, Obamacare, for the first time, looks safe. ''This is reality,'' the president said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ever since Theodore Roosevelt, our decision makers have pushed for a national health insurance program. Stuff always happened. Back in the 1970s, Representative Wilbur Mills, the super-powerful chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, thought he had President Gerald Ford ''convinced on national health.'' But Mills failed to get the bill out of committee due, he said much later, to the fact that he was drinking a half gallon of vodka a day and had hallucinations about buzzards chasing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anyone who watched the disaster that health care created for the Clinton administration might have had reason to dodge the subject for another century. But Obama pushed the bill through, even when a great many members of his party were begging him to drop the whole thing and do something easier, about jobs or taxes, that would get more traction in the next election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also, give some credit to Nancy Pelosi. When things looked bleakest -- after Ted Kennedy had died, and Republicans won his seat -- Democrats started to backtrack, but Pelosi stood firm. ''We'll go through the gate. If the gate's closed, we'll go over the fence. If the fence is too high, we'll pole vault in,'' she said. ''If that doesn't work, we'll parachute in. But we're going to get health care reform passed for the American people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And darned if they didn't.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the little acts of subversion that creeps into ''The Simpsons'' every now and then, a helicopter from Fox News was shown in 2010 with a logo, ''Not Racist, But #1 With Racists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it can be said of the Republican Party, a shelter for the kind of dead-enders who used to be Democrats, then Dixiecrats, but have found a home of sorts in the attic of the Party of Lincoln. It's encouraging to see some party leaders trying to sweep these dark-hearted elements out, but they have work to do yet -- starting with Donald Trump. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accused killer of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., Dylann Roof, appears to have been moved to mass murder by incendiary tracts turned out by a white supremacist group, the Council of Conservative Citizens. The leader of that same group, Earl Holt III, has donated more than $60,000 to various Republican office holders and candidates, including the presidential aspirants Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The candidates, of course, are shocked -- shocked! -- that an extremist hate group would contribute to their cause, and most of them have now returned the money or given it to a fund for victims' families. But it raises an obvious question: why would someone whose ideas belong in the graveyard of history contribute, across the board, to leading Republican conservatives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Guilt by association can be unfair, or at least calls out for nuance. So let's move on to a more overt racial firebomber in the party, Trump, who is polling second -- just behind Jeb Bush -- in one recent survey of New Hampshire Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trump does not use dog whistles or code words. He's blunt. And his wealth affords him a halo of respect in some circles that a low-rent racist would not get. In the spasm of surreal narcissism that was his presidential announcement earlier this month, Trump said some things you would expect to hear at a Klan rally -- 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you,'' he said. ''They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because Trump is a buffoon, a punch-line and a fact-checker's full-time project, he gets away with things that more serious candidates cannot. So Mexicans -- and by extension, all immigrants -- are not ''you,'' but rapists, druglords and leeches in our fair land. Ha-ha. That Trump -- what a straight-shooter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For his ''insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants,'' Univision, the Spanish-language broadcaster, just dumped its relationship with Trump's Miss Universe pageant. (He's a part-owner.) Great. Now where are the Republican leaders -- supposedly intent on trying to make the party something more than a collection of grievance-gorged old white guys -- giving Trump a similar message?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trump also has consistently challenged President Obama's legitimacy as an American citizen, making a clearly racist play in his questioning of the president's place of birth, even after the release of a long-form birth certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Money insulates Trump. But the same cannot be said of Mike Huckabee, who also questioned the president's American authenticity, concocting a lie about how ''his childhood'' in Kenya shaped his worldview. Huckabee sent a well-received video, in 1993, to the supremacist Citizens Council, though he later condemned the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Huckabee's buddy -- a ''patriot and a friend,'' in his words -- is Ted Nugent, a raisined rocker who often appears on stage with a Confederate flag, wrapped in it or wearing it. It was Nugent who called President Obama ''a subhuman mongrel.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's yield to a British-born comedian, John Oliver, to set Lost Cause apologists straight: ''The Confederate flag is one of those symbols that should really only be seen on T-shirts, belt buckles and bumper stickers to help the rest of us identify the worst people in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The House whip, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, has had trouble trying to explain why he spoke, in 2002, to a white supremacist group founded by the former Klan leader David Duke. Scalise now says he finds the group's beliefs repugnant. But earlier this year, Duke told a radio interviewer that Scalise ''agreed with all my ideas.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The party label is meaningless. The white South was solidly Democratic after the Civil War, vowing never to vote for the party that liberated the slaves. A hundred years later, the white South changed allegiances with the advent of the civil rights movement. Richard Nixon then sealed the transformation with his Southern Strategy, which parked Southern whites firmly in the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the many Republicans who believe in free markets, less government and the racial legacy of Lincoln, the question has to be asked: What do some of society's worst elements see in their party? It's the coded language, yes, the hard voices of its broadcast wing, but also actions. Of late, this is the party that has been behind restrictive voting measures aimed squarely at blacks. Don't give racists anything to root for, and they'll crawl back under their rocks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following inflammatory remarks that Mr. Trump made about Mexican immigrants during his presidential announcement, NBC said in a statement that it was ending its business relationship with the billionaire real estate and media mogul.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC has told Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate and former star of ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' reality show, that he's fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Trump made inflammatory remarks about Mexican immigrants, NBC said in a statement Monday that it was ending its business relationship with the billionaire real estate and media mogul. During his June 16 announcement that he was running for president, Mr. Trump referred to immigrants as ''rapists'' and ''murderers.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Citing the ''derogatory statements,'' NBC said it would also no longer air the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, which were part of a venture between Mr. Trump and the network.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump had taken steps to distance himself from ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' while he pursued his presidential campaign because of the conflict it presented. NBC, which had renewed the program for another season, would not allow Mr. Trump to appear on the air while running for office because of concerns that other candidates could request equal airtime. But he could have come back -- and NBC probably would have welcomed him back -- if he had dropped his bid at any point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his comments on Mexico and immigration made his relationship with the network untenable, and he appears to have permanently lost NBC as a platform for ''The Apprentice'' or any other program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, Univision said it would no longer air Mr. Trump's pageants after his remarks. Mr. Trump suggested that he might take legal action for breach of contract and banned Univision executives from using his golf course in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By Monday, a Change.org petition urging NBC to end its relationship with Mr. Trump had garnered more than 200,000 signatures, adding to pressure on the network to end the relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The show was once a hit for NBC, but its viewership has waned in recent years. In its first season in 2004, it gave NBC a much-needed ratings boost when the show averaged almost 21 million viewers, according to Nielsen. But the most recent season of ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' brought in 7.6 million viewers an episode, an improvement over each of the previous two seasons but significantly lower than in the first five seasons. The most recent season, which ended in February, was the first ''Celebrity Apprentice'' season since 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nevertheless, NBC said it would move forward with the show. It said the show was ''licensed from Mark Burnett's United Artists Media Group, and that relationship will continue.'' The network did not say who would replace Mr. Trump as host.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also Monday, Ora TV, a production company co-founded by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Hel&uacute; and the TV personality Larry King, canceled a program it was working on with some of Mr. Trump's companies, Reuters reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump has brushed off criticism over his comments and has said his wealth gives him the ability to speak his mind freely without worrying about political backlash or the need to please donors. He said in an interview with CNN over the weekend that he was forgoing millions of dollars in business opportunities to pursue his run for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the loss of his NBC platform, Mr. Trump's presidential bid became more personally costly. However, at a news conference Monday in Chicago, he stood by his immigration comments and said NBC had been unhappy with him since he decided to run for president and step away from his show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I told NBC I could not change my stance,'' Mr. Trump said, suggesting the network could face a lawsuit for violating their contract. ''The fact is that my stance on immigration is correct.'' Mr. Trump also derided the company over its handling of Brian Williams, the news anchor who was demoted after embellishing his reporting experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They will stand behind lying Brian Williams, but won't stand behind people that tell it like it is, as unpleasant as that may be,'' Mr. Trump said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Donald Trump makes the rest of the Republican presidential primary field look responsible, Chris Christie threatens to make the others look boring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Christie is no longer a front-runner. Donors are not lining up at his door. Yet because of a combination of factors -- not the least of which is his personality -- the New Jersey governor is destined to be a factor in the 2016 presidential race, which he will officially join on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than any other candidate, Mr. Christie is poised to run a race that sells his personality -- brash, challenging and often combative -- as his main asset. He has become a maestro of the town hall meeting, standing in a suit taking questions from New Jersey residents around the state until none remain, leaving some people enraged but many more laughing, weeping or hoping he would come over and clasp their hand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His aides plan to use his natural gifts as a performer as their main weapon against a field in which his main competitors have either never experienced the heat of a national race, or have not run a campaign in many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His speaking ability and his performance allow him to command a room the way no other candidate can,'' said Scott W. Reed, the top political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most urgent imperative for Mr. Christie is to get into the debates. The first one is being hosted by Fox News, and only candidates scoring in the top 10 in the polls will make the cut. Mr. Christie's aides believe he will clear that threshold -- and once there, he more than anyone besides Mr. Trump will make the most of his airtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The debates will be interesting,'' predicted William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard and a sometimes-critic of Mr. Christie. It will be on that stage that all will have a chance to make their mark, he said, but Mr. Christie, with his quickness and ability to read a moment, is best positioned for a breakout moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the debates, assuming he makes a positive impression, Mr. Christie could potentially draw significant support in New Hampshire, where the town hall forums that he has mastered are a critical part of campaigning. Getting attention has never been one of Mr. Christie's problems, and in New Hampshire, where candidates are almost all covered with interest by the local news media, he has a chance to make a stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His speaking ability and his performance allow him to command a room the way no other candidate can,'' Mr. Reed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Christie has suggested he will look to put down roots in Iowa. But people close to him acknowledge that the most fertile territory for him is in New Hampshire, where the type of working-class white voters with whom he has fared well in the past are more dominant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To that end, Mr. Christie highlighted his humble personal story in a video his aides released Sunday evening, a cutaway from one of his town halls, in which he described his Irish father and Sicilian mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a moment when there is a romanticizing of the white working-class voter across party lines even as that voting group's political power has receded, Mr. Christie could have resonance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The governor, who proudly talks about the more than 100 Bruce Springsteen concerts he has attended, is highlighting his humble personal background -- working-class notes that contrast him with Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and the candidate whom others are already trying to isolate over his privileged background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People in New Hampshire insist Mr. Christie would have a chance to make a comeback and take the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think New Hampshire is wide open, more wide open than any race I've seen since 1972,'' said Steve Duprey, a veteran Republican operative and national committee member. ''There's no heir apparent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We don't have as many social conservatives in this state'' as in Iowa, he added. ''I think his style of campaigning, direct interaction with voters and all comers, he could do very well in New Hampshire.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Christie competes most directly with Mr. Bush, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and potentially Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who is considering the race. Yet Mr. Walker is signaling he will most likely pin his fortunes to the Iowa caucuses, and Mr. Graham may not play well in a crowded field in a Northeastern state. That means Mr. Christie is essentially in a three-way competition with Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush, for whom New Hampshire is seen as a must-succeed state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Mr. Christie comes with considerable baggage -- his unfavorable ratings in polls are quite high, potentially leaving him little chance to be anything but a spoiler against another candidate, such as Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He has been a larger-than-life figure in Republican consciousness for how many years now?'' asked Alex Castellanos, a former adviser to Mitt Romney and a frequent critic of Mr. Christie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We loved him because he was 400 pounds of uncontrollable nitroglycerin,'' Mr. Castellanos said. ''And now we fear him because he's 400 pounds of uncontrollable nitroglycerin.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump has boasted that running for president is cheap for him, but in recent days the costs have been creeping up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Univision and NBC Universal already severed ties with him, and Macy's on Wednesday announced it was phasing out his fashion line and ending its relationship with him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump has stood by his remarks that those Mexicans sneaking across the border are rapists and criminals, arguing that his critics are trying to avoid the issue of immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But companies are not having it, and more backlash could be on the way. Petitions created on Change.org and MoveOn.org are putting pressure on more businesses to distance themselves from Mr. Trump and gathering more signatures to punish other parts of his real estate and business empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One petition with more than 70 supporters is calling on the P.G.A. of America to end its relationship with Mr. Trump's golf courses and the Cadillac Championship, which is held at the Trump National Doral in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He needs to be shown that his behavior belongs to another century,&quot;wrote Kevin Wynn in his petition. &quot;Golfers like me look up to the P.G.A. and thus follow, support, view and attend your golf events, and would like to continue to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another petition calls on Amazon, the online retail giant, to stop sales of all of Mr. Trump's 16 books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a man that prides himself on making good business deals, who wrote the book 'The Art of the Deal,' he sure doesn't know how to deal with an America that has evolved to no longer accept vitriol like that spoken at his campaign announcement,&quot; wrote Julian Gomez on a petition that has nearly 700 signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Amazon responded to consumer complaints and stopped selling the Confederate flag after the massacre at a church in Charleston, S.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians are also under pressure to stay away from Mr. Trump. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York is being called upon to cancel the city's contract for a golf course in Ferry Point in the Bronx because of Mr. Trump's remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taxes paid by the very Mexican-American community which Trump insulted funded his luxurious golf course that is out of the reach for most Bronxites,&quot; wrote Ed Conde, who filed a petition asking the city to cancel the Ferry Point contract. The petition has attracted more than 1,200 supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen if more companies will look to disassociate themselves from Mr. Trump, but running for president is likely to be more expensive than he anticipated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the thought of Donald Trump has been lodged in your head of late, exclusively as a Republican presidential candidate, defamer of immigrants and thrice-wed champion of traditional marriage, then it may have escaped your attention that a lush and extravagant municipal golf course bearing his name -- Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point -- opened this spring on the southeastern shoreline of the Bronx. Paid for by New York City, to the sum of $127 million, and maintained by the Trump organization, the course offers the kind of visual lessons in inequality that make statistics and editorials and Thomas Piketty seem ponderously inefficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The view from the hilly course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, accommodates the entirety of the Manhattan skyline across the East River; from one vantage point, all you see is 432 Park Avenue protruding from billionaire's row. A stretch of housing projects borders the links and so does a tightly packed cemetery, St. Raymond's, near the Whitestone Bridge, a reminder that in New York death really is an extension of life -- so much noise and not enough room. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For years, the notion that a luxury golf course would be built in the city's most impoverished borough struck many as the equivalent of handing a camisole to a person with frostbite. The justification had been not simply that the enterprise would constitute a means of job creation for Bronx residents -- which indeed it has -- but also that the course would be so challenging in its play and so indistinguishable from a country club in its sensibility that it would attract major championship competition and in turn millions of dollars in revenue for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But how likely is it now that the United States Open, so dependent on corporate sponsorships, will be scheduled on a public course named for someone who said he is committed to building a wall at the Mexican border to keep out drug dealers and ''rapists''? Although you could argue that none of his comments could have been anticipated, getting blindsided by craziness from Mr. Trump is like landing at a monastery only to be surprised that it's quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A day after Mr. Trump told the Golf Channel that he had ''tremendous support from the golf world because they all know I'm right,'' the country's major professional golf associations issued a joint statement saying, ''Mr. Trump's comments are inconsistent with our strong commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment in the game of golf.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That followed the move on the part of NBC Universal to sever ties with Mr. Trump on his television projects and an announcement from the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that it would no longer consider Trump hotels as sites for two conventions next year that make up the largest meetings of Hispanic business leaders in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He has no idea what's coming,'' the organization's president, Javier Palomarez, told me. ''The Hispanic community is really galvanized around this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Trump's involvement in the Ferry Point project highlights the problematic nature of public-private partnerships and the mistakes we make when we assign amusement-value status to people who might actually mean what they say. His position in the presidential race, catering to the far right, leaves him saying so many things potentially threatening to his business interests that it raises the question of whether he really is as much an ideologue as he is an entertainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement saying that he found Mr. Trump's remarks ''offensive and disgusting,'' Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, added that the city would review its contracts with the Trump organization, which is receiving five years of free rent at Ferry Point while Mr. Trump builds a $10 million clubhouse that the company expects to finish next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, the city itself has not been an exemplary steward at Ferry Point, and what it has reaped from the Trump deal isn't necessarily obvious. When the construction of the golf course got underway during the Bloomberg administration after a long and complicated history, the city offered certain palliatives in an attempt at precluding and appeasing the inevitable critics. One of the concessions, a nine-and-a-half-acre community park that separates one thread of the course's perimeter from the Throggs Neck Houses, still doesn't have a bathroom three years after it opened. While it is under construction, water fountains and sprinklers remain inoperable. (One young mother told me that she remembered a drinking fountain working once, last year, though when she went to use it the water was hot.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a recent afternoon, the playground, which looks like a Scandinavian experiment of the kind that might forgo the placement of actual swings, asking children to instead close their eyes and imagine them, was sparsely populated. Several parents told me that was fairly typical, given how little there was to do there. ''This is basically a playground with a slide,'' the father of a 2-year-old girl said. Many more children were occupying themselves in the playgrounds of the projects across the street, which were better equipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The vast expanse of Ferry Point Park that lies opposite the golf course on the other side of the Whitestone Bridge, a park crowded on the weekends with Latino immigrants, has been teased with the prospect of amenities for decades. In the 1930s, Robert Moses planned a beach, bathhouse and bus terminal there. ''Unfortunately, the plan was never implemented,'' the parks department website notes. Three years ago, when I visited for the first time, the department said that bathrooms in that part of the park were about to be built. They still don't exist, according to the department, because of delays related to Hurricane Sandy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's no doubt that Mr. Trump could get them done faster. But who wants to ask him?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday&nbsp;that Republicans have been doing themselves&nbsp;no favors when it comes to courting the crucial Hispanic vote and warned&nbsp;that Donald J. Trump should not be the party's spokesman on the issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My party is in a hole with Hispanics - the first rule of politics when you're in a hole is stop digging,&quot; Mr. Graham said after a foreign policy speech in Washington. &quot;And somebody needs to take the shovel out of Donald&nbsp;Trump's hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Graham, the presidential candidate from South Carolina, disputed Mr. Trump's assertion that Mexican immigrants who cross into the United States are rapists and criminals, adding that he did not need a lecture from the billionaire businessman on border security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of them are good hard-working people cleaning our toilets, picking the crops that we all enjoy, changing the beds and working three or four jobs in the shadows to try to keep their family afloat,&quot; Mr. Graham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator said that his own party had clearly made mistakes on the immigration issue over the years, as evidenced by the steep fall in support among Hispanic voters recently. However, he pushed back against comments from Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said on Tuesday that Republicans operate on a spectrum of hostility toward immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to remind anybody who cares about immigration reform, that Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and the stimulus went ahead of you,&quot; Mr. Graham said, recalling that President Obama and Democrats had majorities in Congress when he took office. &quot;He didn't do a damn thing and Hillary Clinton never lifted a finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Graham touched on domestic policy, the bulk of his remarks were dedicated to foreign affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed skepticism about the prospect of a nuclear deal with Iran, saying that a bad agreement could lead to chaos in the Middle East. And he compared the rise of the Islamic State with Nazi Germany, calling for the deployment of 10,000 American troops to Syria to quell the growth of the militant group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point a member of the liberal activist group Code Pink confronted Mr. Graham on his worldview, accusing him of being a warmonger and saying that Republicans were responsible the growing threat of terrorism around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Graham closed his eyes and wiped his eyebrow until she relinquished the microphone. After joking that she was apparently undecided on his candidacy, he turned serious and said: &quot;I think people like you make the world incredibly dangerous. I think people like you are radical Islam's best hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. Buress&amp;#8217;s new Comedy Central show debuted Wednesday with a combination of standup and fitfully funny sketches. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannibal Buress meant it when he said he didn't want to talk about Bill Cosby anymore. He could have addressed the latest Cosby revelation (this week's report that Mr. Cosby had acknowledged procuring sedatives to drug women) in the first episode of his Comedy Central series, &quot;Why? With Hannibal Buress,&quot; on Wednesday night. (Episodes of the show are taped the day before broadcast.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he didn't rise to the bait. His only reference to the ongoing scandal was a mention of &quot;Cosby assassins,&quot; a variation on a line he's already used in his stand-up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It might have been disappointing for celebrity schadenfreudists, but it made sense. Continuing to rip Mr. Cosby, whose current troubles were largely spurred by a Buress riff (the crux of which was, &quot;You rape women, Bill Cosby&quot;), would constitute piling on. It could also be a tactical error, drawing attention to a lurking question: would Mr. Buress have his own television show if it weren't for the attention the Cosby routine received?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he did talk about, during a surprisingly old-fashioned opening monologue, was Donald Trump's presidential aspirations, the Greek financial crisis and the dullness of soccer - standard topics for the kind of comic-commentary show &quot;Why?&quot; Is being promoted as. But then he veered into a diatribe about male hotel housekeepers that had some of the sneaky, subterranean charge of his standup. (&quot;Get out of there, dude! Stop touching my stuff.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing at the front tip of a large, bare, wedge-shaped stage that seemed to be sending some kind of message - plain-spokenness? transparency? aggression? - he spent the rest of the half-hour show introducing taped segments and scripted sketches. These were mostly underwhelming. A fake audition for the &quot;Daily Show&quot; hosting job (in which Mr. Buress affected complete indifference) and a parody of the &quot;I Don't Answer Questions&quot; police-stop viral videos were worth a few chuckles; the closing &quot;8th of July&quot; sketch was just strange for its own sake, though it did demonstrate that a line like &quot;Why are lambs the only animal that tastes really good and we also use them for condoms&quot; is funnier when sung in an operatic baritone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one sketch that really hit benefited from the presence of Amy Schumer as Mr. Buress's No. 1 Twitter troll and virulently jealous colleague: &quot;Comedy Central's MY network! Nobody watches two television shows.&quot; It was also part of a rich vein of network promotion - in addition to the sketches invoking the Comedy Central shows &quot;Inside Amy Schumer&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; Mr. Buress worked in an approving reference to &quot;Broad City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of &quot;Why?&quot; contributes to an interesting trend at Comedy Central, where mainstays like the hosts Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart and the correspondent John Oliver, all white, have left or are leaving and the black hosts Larry Wilmore, Trevor Noah and Mr. Buress are moving in. Generalizing about this is folly. But it's safe to say that Mr. Stewart, Mr. Colbert and Mr. Oliver shared an affect - theatrical, heightened, sometimes histrionic - very different from that of Mr. Wilmore and especially Mr. Buress. (Mr. Noah won't take over &quot;The Daily Show&quot; until September.) Mr. Buress has a cool, reserved, almost recessive presence. When he gets loud he seems to be forcing himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course part of that has to do with the nature of the show - &quot;Why?,&quot; at 10:30 p.m., may be covering many of the same topics as the late-night mock-news shows but its ratio of comedy to polemics is higher. That would seem to make it a good fit for Mr. Buress, but based on the scant evidence of one episode, there could be problems - the observational, idiosyncratic sensibility that serves him so well in stand-up may not be as effective in 21 or 22 minutes of tightly formatted topical comedy. (And even when playing himself, his acting skills are limited.) But that's one blessing of doing a show on the fly - plenty of room for adjustments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Donald J. Trump will come to Phoenix on Saturday to address the contentious issue of immigration again, even as city leaders have asked the billionaire businessman &amp;#8220;to stage his hate-filled circus&amp;#8221; elsewhere. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul who has tied Republicans in knots in recent weeks with his comments on immigration, will roll into Phoenix on Saturday to address the issue again, just after the head of the Republican Party supposedly asked him to tone down his words on the issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planned speech is already attracting a storm of attention. Even as city leaders have asked Mr. Trump &quot;to stage his hate-filled circus&quot; elsewhere, ticket requests have been so high the campaign has moved the speech from the swank Arizona Biltmore hotel to the convention center downtown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Trump certainly has a First Amendment right to bluster as much as he wants, and even to pander to our worst instincts in a sad attempt to win votes at the expense of hard-working, honorable, law-abiding Latinos,&quot; Daniel Valenzuela, a Democratic councilman and the city's vice mayor, said on Thursday. &quot;However, we should draw the line at allowing him to use the Phoenix Convention Center - a public building funded by all of our taxpayers' dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Greg Stanton, also a Democrat, issued a similar statement condemning Mr. Trump and his remarks, but assured that the city would not try to prevent the candidate from speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said on Friday that 4,500 tickets had already been reserved for the speech, 3,500 more than initially expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump will appear onstage with Joe Arpaio, the long-serving sheriff of surrounding Maricopa County, whose tactics to track down and deport illegal immigrants have drawn national attention and a federal conviction for racial profiling in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump has attracted sharp criticism from business and political leaders since asserting in his campaign announcement that those crossing the United States-Mexico border illegally include rapists and criminals. The remarks led several businesses, including Macy's, Univision and NBC, to cut their ties with the developer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans will be watching the weekend swing through the desert closely to see if Mr. Trump tempers his language on the issue. This week, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was said to have urged Mr. Trump in a phone call on Wednesday to soften his tone on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump is expected to start the day on Saturday in Las Vegas, where he will speak at FreedomFest, an annual libertarian-leaning gathering that bills itself as the &quot;world's largest gathering of free minds.&quot; Ms. Hicks said he will also hold a press conference after the event.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inequality, in Trump's Name</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In last Sunday's Big City column, Ginia Bellafante wrote about Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, the publicly financed golf course built by Donald J. Trump in the Bronx. Readers responded on nytimes.com. Comments have been edited for length and clarity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ''comments'' issued by the nation's leading golf organizations regarding Trump's ignorant and bigoted pronouncements are meaningless unless and until they follow Univision, Macy's and others and sever ties with His Royal Fatuousness. The fact is that, with some notable exceptions, golf is a game played by and focused upon, older, wealthy, white people -- just like the Donald -- and I do not expect those organizations to do anything to such a high-profile golf booster. Jason Shapiro, Santa Fe </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a resident of Throgs Neck in the area where this course is, I can confirm that this article is spot on. The adjoining park is indeed barren, not just of water and play equipment and bathrooms, but of trees. In the summer the park is a scorching plain. There is one other thing you won't find there: people. Meanwhile Ferry Point Park is abutted by warehouses and a city construction-vehicle area (honestly, I'm not sure what it is). Last I was there the road was a wreck. $127 million? Bronx residents could have done a lot better with that money. If the city ever has another $127 million to spend in the Bronx, perhaps we can have a bigger say in how it gets spent. LAZ, Bronx, N.Y. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm surprised at the anti-Trump comments. As one reader says, this is a good thing that has been created for those who live in the area. The article says that the Trump Organization maintains the property, so why all the fuss? The reason that Trump is rising in the polls is because a lot of what he says is what a lot of Americans are thinking anyway and want to hear someone say out loud. The Latino backlash is out of proportion to what he actually said. Kathleen, Boston </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though experience has proved it wrong, a myth persists among business writers and pundits that the Republicans manage the nation's money better than the Democrats. Donald&nbsp;Trump fits the G.O.P. like a glove, not only for his prejudices, but for his history of fiscal management. He did something that's just about impossible unless you cook the books -- go bankrupt running a casino. Mancuroc, Rochester, N.Y. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;At a time when many Republicans are racing to distance themselves from Donald J. Trump, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is stressing his close friendship with the real estate mogul, even as he criticizes Mr. Trump&amp;#8217;s remarks on immigrants. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when many Republicans are racing to distance themselves from Donald J. Trump, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is forging an unusual path: He's taking pains to emphasize that, although he found Mr. Trump's comments on illegal immigrants &quot;inappropriate,&quot; the real estate baron is a &quot;friend,&quot; the two are &quot;close&quot; and Mr. Trump is &quot;a good guy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tactic - a hate-the-sin, love-the-sinner approach to politics - is striking because Mr. Christie has long prided himself on the depth of his support from Latinos, who reacted with anger and dismay to Mr. Trump's assertion that Mexicans sneaking across the border are rapists and criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, Mr. Christie denounced Mr. Trump's caustic words on immigrants on Mr. Christie's second day as an official candidate for president, saying at a campaign event in Nashua, N.H., that &quot;the comments were inappropriate and have no place in this race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as for the man himself? Here's a few of the nicer things Mr. Christie has had to say about Mr. Trump:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 1: Mr. Christie told Sean Hannity of Fox News that the first thing that came to mind when he heard Mr. Trump's name was &quot;a friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 3: &quot;I like Donald. He's a good guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 6: &quot;He tries to provoke reaction, that's part of who Donald is.&quot; Mr. Christie also added that Mr. Trump is a &quot;good friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Monday morning, on &quot;Fox and Friends,&quot; Mr. Christie said he had had enough with the Trump questions. &quot;Donald is a friend, I've known him for 13 years, and I like him personally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;But his comments were inappropriate. That's now the 50th time I've said it. It's going to be the last time I say it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two have indeed been friends for a while. But Mr. Christie's frequent pledges of friendship mark a curious and potentially treacherous path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor has made outreach to the Latino community a centerpiece of both his record and his campaign: He won over 50 percent of the Latino vote in his re-election, a fact he regularly trumps on the campaign trail, and he took a three-day trip to Mexico in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the proposals that he has outlined on immigration and boarder security - that a fence along the southern border is ineffective and sends the wrong message - run in direct contrast to Mr. Trump's promise to build as grand and imposing a border fence as humanly possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps those disagreements are best worked out among friends.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. Breathed, who won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning during the 1980s run of his comic strip, published a new comic on Facebook on Monday. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generally, when a beloved comic strip disappears from the funnies page, it is gone for good, and its characters live on only in reprint collections and greeting cards, as parade balloons and insurance spokes-characters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was a surprise for comics fans to wake up on Monday and discover that Berkeley Breathed, the Pulitzer Prize-winning creator and artist of &quot;Bloom County,&quot; had revived that vintage 1980s strip on his Facebook page after a hiatus of more than 25 years (depending on how one measures) and with almost no advance notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first installment of Mr. Breathed's &quot;Bloom County&quot; comic appeared in 1980, and,  over its nine-year run, introduced readers to memorably offbeat characters such as Opus, a talking penguin, and the bug-eyed, often unintelligible Bill the Cat. The strip frequently satirized social issues and political miscreants of the era including South African apartheid and a then-ascendant real-estate tycoon named Donald Trump - and Mr. Breathed won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1987, a distinction that was protested by some of his fellow artists. (Pat Oliphant, also a Pulitzer winner, said that &quot;Bloom County&quot; was guilty of &quot;passing off shrill potty jokes and grade-school sight gags as social commentary.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But alongside fellow cartoonists like Gary Larson (&quot;The Far Side&quot;) and Bill Watterson (&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;), Mr. Breathed was part of a brief 1980s renaissance in comic strips. At its peak, &quot;Bloom County&quot; reached more than 40 million readers in more than 1,200 newspapers, until Mr. Breathed stopped illustrating new installments of it in 1989. He continued some of its characters in a Sunday-only comic, &quot;Outland,&quot; that ran from 1989 to 1995, and later in another Sunday-only series, &quot;Opus,&quot; that was published from 2003 to 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, on Sunday, Mr. Breathed published a photo on his Facebook page that showed him working on a comic strip entitled &quot;Bloom County 2015.&quot; An accompanying caption said: &quot;A return after 25 years. Feels like going home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a new &quot;Bloom County&quot; comic strip, reacquainting readers with Opus and his human friend Milo Bloom, appeared the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Breathed did not immediately reply to a request for comment through his literary agent. On his Facebook page, he provided a (possibly fanciful) explanation for why he was reviving &quot;Bloom County&quot; now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a reader who noted that Mr. Trump was also making his return to the political stage, Mr. Breathed wrote, &quot;This creator can't precisely deny that the chap you mention had nothing to do with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathryn Steinle was killed on a pier in San Francisco on July 1, allegedly by a troubled immigrant who had a stolen gun and a long criminal history and had been deported five times. The shooting was inexplicable, yet Ms. Steinle's family and friends have been shunning talk of politics and vengeance, while expressing the hope that some good might emerge from this tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has turned the usual American tensions over immigration into a frenzy. The accused, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, has become the dark-skinned face of the Mexican killers that Donald Trump -- in a racist speech announcing his presidential campaign, and numerous interviews thereafter -- has been warning the nation about. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others in the race and in Congress have eagerly joined him in exploiting the crime, proposing bills to punish ''sanctuary cities,'' like San Francisco, that discourage local involvement in immigration enforcement, and to force them to cooperate with the federal government in an ever-wider, harsher deportation dragnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lopez-Sanchez was a repeat illegal border-crosser with a drug record, but he somehow ended up back on the street. His case led to epic rounds of blame-shifting last week, as the various government agencies that had Mr. Lopez-Sanchez in their custody at some point -- like the San Francisco sheriff's office and Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- tried to explain why this wasn't their fault. Right-wing commenters and politicians, shamelessly willing to scapegoat 11 million unauthorized immigrants as a criminal class and national-security threat, were pointing fingers at anyone and everyone, from President Obama on down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lost in the screaming were the sound reasons that cities and localities shun the role of immigration enforcers. They are balancing public safety with a respect for civil rights and the Constitution. San Francisco had received an ICE request, called a detainer, to hold Mr. Lopez-Sanchez, but detainers are unconstitutional; a person can't be held without charge just for ICE's convenience. Turning the local police and sheriff's deputies into de facto ICE agents heightens fear and distrust in immigrant communities, which makes fighting crime harder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lost, too, is the truth that immigrants are by no definition a population of criminals. A report published last week by the American Immigration Council found that immigrants -- whether legal or unauthorized, and no matter their country of origin or education level -- are less likely to be criminals than native-born Americans, that periods of high immigration correspond with lower crime rates, and that this has been true in this country as long as this issue has been studied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Separating real threats from the harmless, productive majority of immigrants has long been a challenge. For years the Obama administration made the problem worse through a misguided program of local-level immigration policing called Secure Communities. It became a dragnet, shredding trust between residents and the local police in immigrant communities. Over time, hundreds of jurisdictions refused to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, last fall announced his plan to replace Secure Communities with a new Priority Enforcement Program, which would only seek custody of immigrants convicted of certain serious crimes, and only by asking the local authorities to notify ICE about their imminent release. If the program had been in place in San Francisco earlier in the year, a phone call might have kept Mr. Lopez-Sanchez off the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Priority Enforcement Program needs to work with cities and law-enforcement agencies across the board -- to reassure those that are rightly wary of ICE and to restrain those that are only too eager to overreach and abuse their power. But with strong protections against racial profiling, it could strike the balance. ''It's irresponsible,'' Mr. Johnson told The Times, ''not to have some sort of program or protocol by which we work with local sheriffs and police chiefs to transfer dangerous criminals who are undocumented to us.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump's surge in the polls shows no signs of abating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The business mogul and Republican presidential candidate is in a statistical tie with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in a Suffolk University/USA Today national poll of potential primary voters released on Tuesday. The survey is the latest in a succession of strong showings since Mr. Trump announced his campaign last month and made inflammatory comments about illegal immigrants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump has the support of 17 percent of Republican or independent voters who say they plan to participate in the party's primary elections or caucuses, while Mr. Bush has 14 percent; the difference is within the survey's margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump is making daily headlines in advance of the primary season,&quot; said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston. &quot;This has vaulted him to the top of the pack on the backs of conservative voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush, the top tier of Republican candidates in the poll includes Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same polling outfit showed Mr. Bush with a small lead over Mr. Trump in New Hampshire in June. The two Republicans have been sparring verbally in recent weeks and have remained virtually deadlocked in recent voter surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans who are worried about Mr. Trump's ascent argue that it is still early in the race and that his poll numbers are driven by his name recognition. According to the Suffolk University poll, 30 percent of Republican voters are undecided about who they will support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump has said that he would be the strongest Republican to take on Hillary Rodham Clinton in a general election and suggested that she was afraid to face him. However, the Suffolk poll shows her beating him handily head to head, 51 percent to 34 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and others competed to criticize the deal the most harshly and in the most cataclysmic terms. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential candidates fell all over themselves today trying to see who could condemn the nuclear deal with Iran the most quickly and in the most cataclysmic terms. It made no difference whether they actually knew anything about the deal, about Iran, about nuclear arms, or about foreign policy in general. They had their attacks ready, just as they have had and will have to anything President Obama does or wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who reportedly has been getting briefings on foreign affairs because he's the governor of a Midwestern state with no actual experience in the area, announced: &quot;The deal allows Tehran to dismantle U.S. and international sanctions without dismantling its illicit nuclear infrastructure - giving Iran's nuclear weapons capability an American stamp of approval.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, no. It requires Iran to dismantle a great deal of its &quot;illicit nuclear infrastructure&quot; before sanctions start to be lifted, would restore them and impose more if Iran cheats, and keeps in place many sanctions based on Iran's human rights record and its support for terrorist organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shame on the Obama administration for agreeing to a deal&nbsp;that empowers an evil Iranian regime to&nbsp;carry out its threat to 'wipe Israel off the map' and bring 'death to America,'&quot; said Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Huckabee, like the rest of the G.O.P. field, offers not a clue as to how he would prevent Iran from doing those things, which don't actually require a nuclear weapon, which the United States and Israel have, by the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on what we know thus far, I believe that this deal undermines our national security,&quot; said Marco Rubio, the Florida senator. Mr. Rubio said the United States should ratchet up sanctions until Iran agrees to completely dismantle its nuclear program. It's long been clear that won't happen, and it could never be verified in any case without a deal like the one Mr. Obama and other world leaders signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A comprehensive agreement should require Iran to verifiably abandon - not simply delay - its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability,&quot; said Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida. Well, yes, that would have been comprehensive. Again, it was never going to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would Mr. Bush argue that a succession of United States presidents should not have negotiated arms deals with the Soviet Union because they did not lead to full, unilateral disarmament and a renunciation of communism? I hope not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same applies to a comment by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who said: &quot;The deal threatens Israel, it threatens the United States, and it turns 70 years of nuclear policy on its head.&quot; It does not do those things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of my favorite lines of attack was the one voiced by (among others) Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas and former spectacular failure in the Republican primary process. &quot;President Obama's decision to sign a nuclear deal with Iran is one of the most destructive foreign policy decisions in my lifetime,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seriously?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about the Bay of Pigs; Vietnam; the secret bombing of Cambodia; the invasion of Cambodia; the C.I.A. plot to overthrow and perhaps murder the president of Chile, ushering in decades of military dictatorship and the slaughter of countless Chileans; Iran-Contra; the failure to take prompt action against the Balkan genocide; the decision to retreat from the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and invade Iraq based on propaganda and disinformation; and the botched invasion of Iraq, which laid the groundwork for regional warfare and the formation of the Islamic State terrorist group?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going back just a few years before Mr. Perry was born in 1950, there was the decision to carve up Europe with Stalin, creating the Soviet bloc, sparking a nuclear arms race and leaving entire nations in bondage to the Kremlin for a half century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, over in the land of reality TV, Donald Trump predicted that the Iranians would cheat. Perhaps they will, but this assessment comes from the man who reportedly told some Hollywood conservatives last Friday that the United States should have invaded Mexico instead of Iraq.</SPAN></P>

Oh, and the unemployed have been blamed for their own plight, food stamp recipients and the disabled portrayed as malingerers. Then along comes Trump, who embodies the base's values, its intellectual outlook, its deep lack of empathy for the unfortunate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was a surprise for comics fans to wake up on Monday and discover that Berkeley Breathed, the Pulitzer Prize-winning creator and artist of ''Bloom County,'' had revived that vintage 1980s strip on his Facebook page after a hiatus of more than 25 years (depending on how one measures) and with almost no advance notice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first installment of Mr. Breathed's ''Bloom County'' comic appeared in 1980, and,  over its nine-year run, introduced readers to memorably offbeat characters such as Opus, a talking penguin, and the bug-eyed, often unintelligible Bill the Cat. The strip frequently satirized social issues and political miscreants of the era including South African apartheid and a then-ascendant real-estate tycoon named Donald Trump -- and Mr. Breathed won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1987, a distinction that was protested by some of his fellow artists. (Pat Oliphant, also a Pulitzer winner, said that ''Bloom County'' was guilty of ''passing off shrill potty jokes and grade-school sight gags as social commentary.'')</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But alongside fellow cartoonists like Gary Larson (''The Far Side'') and Bill Watterson (''Calvin and Hobbes''), Mr. Breathed was part of a brief 1980s renaissance in comic strips. At its peak, ''Bloom County'' reached more than 40 million readers in more than 1,200 newspapers, until Mr. Breathed stopped illustrating new installments of it in 1989. He continued some of its characters in a Sunday-only comic, ''Outland,'' that ran from 1989 to 1995, and later in another Sunday-only series, ''Opus,'' that was published from 2003 to 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, on Sunday, Mr. Breathed published a photo on his Facebook page that showed him working on a comic strip entitled ''Bloom County 2015.'' An accompanying caption said: ''A return after 25 years. Feels like going home.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And a new ''Bloom County'' comic strip, reacquainting readers with Opus and his human friend Milo Bloom, appeared the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On his Facebook page, Mr. Breathed provided a fanciful reason for why he was reviving ''Bloom County'' now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In response to a reader who noted that Mr. Trump was also making his return to the political stage, Mr. Breathed wrote, ''This creator can't precisely deny that the chap you mention had nothing to do with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Breathed provided a fuller explanation of his decision to revive ''Bloom County'' in response to questions sent by email on Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Deadlines and dead-tree media took the fun out of a daily craft that was only meant to be fun,'' Mr. Breathed said. ''I had planned to return to Bloom County in 2001, but the sullied air sucked the oxygen from my kind of whimsy. Bush and Cheney's fake war dropped it for a decade like a bullet to the head. But silliness suddenly seems safe now. Trump's merely a sparkling symptom of a renewed national ridiculousness. We're back baby.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Breathed said he planned to continue publishing new ''Bloom County'' strips online rather than in print newspapers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'll publish on Facebook, as that's where my old school readers can reach me,'' he said. ''I want to hear from them -- hear how my characters played a role in their lives -- hear how they might still. Those of us lucky enough to be granted such a role should thank our fans daily (Harrison Ford finally got that memo). The return of Opus and the old gang is my way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''Newspapers need deadlines, alas. Like my departed friend Douglas Adams used to say, the only part of deadlines I enjoyed was the whooshing sound as they sped by.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Senator Ted Cruz of Texas criticized Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as not being conservative enough. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been an outspoken opponent of what he calls &quot;Republican-on-Republican violence,&quot; and has promised not to &quot;engage in the media's game of throwing rocks and attacking other Republicans.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, he seems to be willing to criticize his Republican rivals for president, so long as he says something nice first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an interview recorded on Wednesday with Al Hunt for PBS, Mr. Cruz said Jeb Bush was someone &quot;who I like, who I respect.&quot; Then he questioned his conservative credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the policy positions he's staking out, whether it is embracing amnesty, whether it is embracing Common Core, are not conservative positions,&quot; Mr. Cruz said. &quot;I think they are in direct conflict with the views of most Republicans.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also criticized Mr. Bush's response to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, saying it &quot;was almost word for word what Barack Obama said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Senator Marco Rubio, someone whom Mr. Cruz has worked with before in the Senate, he had equally pleasant initial things to say: &quot;I like and respect Marco a great deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he continued to question whether Mr. Rubio had fought enough for conservative issues  and that his tenure as solicitor general of Texas gave him much stronger executive experience than Mr. Rubio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Donald Trump, whom he met with privately in New York City on Wednesday, he stuck to his standard line, with no criticism: &quot;I don't express things the same way he does, but I'm glad he is focusing on the problem of illegal immigration.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Donald J. Trump issued a statement Wednesday saying that his net worth was now in excess of $10 billion, more the $8.7 billion he said he was worth when he announced his presidential candidacy just a month ago. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump's wealth is rising with his polling numbers, if his characterization of his own net worth is to be believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump issued a statement Wednesday saying that his net worth was now in excess of $10 billion, more than the $8.7 billion he said he was worth when he announced his presidential candidacy a month ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement noted that Mr. Trump had filed his financial disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission, a requirement of presidential candidates. The statement was full of the bombast often associated with Mr. Trump, including an all-capitalization declaration of his wealth:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump's net worth has increased since the more than one year old financial statement produced at his presidential announcement. Real estate values in New York City, San Francisco, Miami and many other places where he owns property have gone up considerably during this period of time. His debt is a very small percentage of value, and at very low interest rates. As of this date, Mr. Trump[#x201f]s net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Trump's characterizations of his wealth have drawn skepticism in many quarters, partly fueled by his own statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings - even my own feelings - but I try,&quot; he once said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump continues to do well in polls of the Republican field, with a nationwide poll released Tuesday putting him in a statistical tie for the lead with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump declared that he had an income of $362 million in 2014, not including dividends, interest, capital gains, rent and royalties. And he said that he had made $213 million during his 14 seasons hosting NBC's &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; NBC recently ended its relationship with Mr. Trump after remarks he made during his presidential announcement speech in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as &quot;rapists&quot; and &quot;murderers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In filing his financial disclosure, Mr. Trump apparently followed through on a pledge that he made on June 16 when he announced his campaign, saying he would be making the submission without requesting extensions. &quot;We don't need extensions,&quot; he said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his speech announcing his candidacy, Mr. Trump waved a document that he said was a report on his finances, prepared by a large, respected accounting firm, reporting the $8.7 billion figure as his net worth. (He noted then that an updated accounting would probably show his net worth higher than $10 billion.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that figuring out his finances was complicated. &quot;My accountants have been working for months, because it is big and complex,&quot; he added. Of his money, he said much was earning through real estate. &quot;I made it the old-fashioned way,&quot; Mr. Trump said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump and former Gov. Jeb Bush have been deadlocked in recent polls and sniping between the two Republican presidential candidates is getting increasingly personal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the former Florida governor lacks energy and will not deliver on his promises because he is beholden to the big donors who are filling his campaign war chest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody that's reliant on all of these lobbyists and special interests and donors, they have no power,&quot; Mr. Trump said on MSNBC's &quot;Morning Joe.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;The $100 million that he raised is a bad thing, not a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush is leading the crowded Republican field in fund-raising so far, and Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman, argues that his personal wealth empowers him as a candidate. He also said that he will file the required personal financial disclosure forms on Wednesday or Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single person is expecting something for that money and that's not good for the country,&quot; Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bush. &quot;That means you can't make deals that are good for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush has taken issue with Mr. Trump's comments in recent weeks, particularly his remarks that undocumented immigrants from Mexico are criminals and &quot;rapists.&quot; Mr. Bush also took offense to Mr. Trump's suggestion that he has an affinity for Mexicans because his wife is Mexican-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Republican will never win by striking fear in people's hearts,&quot; Mr. Bush said in Iowa on Tuesday, suggesting that his rival was preying on people's angst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump continues to stand by his remarks, but said that they have been distorted and blown out of proportion. He vowed again on Wednesday that he will win the Hispanic vote because he employs thousands of them and knows how to create jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hispanics love me,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LANSING, Mich. --  The last time John R. Kasich contemplated running for president, as an ambitious congressman in 1999, he tried courting Republicans in Iowa only to discover that even the reporter trailing him from his home state, Ohio, was more enthralled with the Texas governor, George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He was like: 'Yeah! I got to meet him!' That's when I knew it was over,'' Mr. Kasich said in a recent interview. Of Mr. Bush, who went on to win the White House in 2000, Mr. Kasich said, ''He just sucked not only all the money but all the oxygen out of the room.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, Mr. Kasich, 63, is the Republican governor of Ohio, an impatient, edgy politician known for his voluble personality and unorthodox views. For months, he has watched the 2016 presidential field as another Bush -- Jeb, a former governor of Florida -- has tried, with less success so far, to replicate his brother George's feat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So now Mr. Kasich is on the verge of jumping in himself, hoping his r&eacute;sum&eacute; --former chairman of the House Budget Committee, former Fox News host, retired Lehman Brothers investment banker and two-term governor of a swing state -- might give him a second chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Tell me,'' Mr. Kasich said on Tuesday to a marketing executive, Lorri Rishar, who asked what distinguished him from the rest of the crowded Republican field. ''Who has national security experience? Who was involved in changing Washington to the tune of a balanced budget and working hard on welfare reform? Who spent 10 years in the private sector and then was an executive of one of the most important states of America and had success? So you tell me -- you're a P.R. person. Does that sound like a good way to talk about it?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the group of about two dozen Michigan business owners who turned out to greet Mr. Kasich for a lunch of wrap sandwiches and potato chips -- on the day that Donald J. Trump announced his candidacy in Manhattan and one day after Mr. Bush announced his to a cheering throng in Miami -- was a reminder of just how tough it will be for him to grab what he called ''the oxygen in the room.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He insisted he did not worry about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Look,'' he asked Ms. Rishar, ''do you play golf? I play my best golf when I don't even know what my score is. So why would I worry about the rest of the field?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The official line from Mr. Kasich is that he has not made up his mind; in fact, he is widely expected to announce his candidacy in July. He is increasing his travel. On Monday, he was in South Carolina. He will make his fifth trip to New Hampshire on Wednesday, and next week, his first to Iowa, a critical state because its caucuses are the first test for candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other signs that Mr. Kasich is running: He has created a political action committee, New Day for America -- John E. Sununu, a former senator from New Hampshire, is on the board -- and is courting donors and hiring staff. Analysts say that despite poll numbers showing that just 2 percent of Republicans back a Kasich candidacy, which puts Mr. Kasich about even with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kasich will have instant credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think the moment that he gets in this race, he is going to get enough lift that he will immediately be in the top five,'' said Matthew J. Dowd, who was the chief strategist for President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. Mr. Dowd predicts Mr. Kasich will eclipse Jeb Bush as ''the establishment candidate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Part of the argument for Mr. Kasich is his record as a two-term governor in a state critical to winning the presidency. Traveling the country, he promotes what he calls his ''Ohio story'' of economic recovery; on his watch, an $8 billion deficit has turned into a surplus, he said, of nearly $2 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If we don't win Ohio as Republicans, it's doubtful that we'll be occupying the White House,'' said Craig Robinson, the publisher of The Iowa Republican, an independent website. ''Here's a guy who won the state twice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Kasich was here in the Michigan capital on Tuesday, people familiar with his operation say Fred Davis, the news media strategist for his political action committee, was back in Los Angeles, working on how to market the relatively unknown candidate. John Weaver, Mr. Kasich's newly hired chief strategist, has a frame of his own. ''I like to say he's a rebel who can govern,'' Mr. Weaver said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rebel tag is apt, but it may go only so far with conservatives. Mr. Kasich has expanded Medicaid under President Obama's health care law, embraced the Common Core educational standards and said he was open to a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- policies that he might have a hard time explaining to conservatives in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think the big obstacle for him is going to be his record as governor,'' Mr. Robinson said. But what looks like an obstacle in Iowa could be an advantage in New Hampshire, said Jeb Bradley, the majority leader of the New Hampshire Senate, citing Mr. Kasich's ''record as a pretty good fiscal conservative and somebody who has grown an economy in a rust belt state.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mr. Kasich's choice of advisers has brought him some grief. Mr. Weaver and Mr. Davis worked for the losing presidential campaigns of other Republican mavericks, Jon Huntsman and John McCain, drawing attacks from conservatives like the commentator Erick Erickson, who wrote, ''One does not run for president in the Republican Party by hiring consultants who hate the Republican base.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Weaver and Mr. Davis dismissed such talk, but Amy Walter, the national editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, says that in Mr. Kasich, a politician with a reputation for shooting from the hip, the two advisers will have their work cut out for them. ''Their strategy was 'Let McCain be McCain, let Huntsman be Huntsman,' '' Ms. Walter said. ''But letting Kasich be Kasich can be dangerous.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here in Michigan, Mr. Kasich seemed loose and relaxed. At an evening reception, he fielded questions on foreign policy and the budget, and tried out his stand-up skills on a man who said he was an economist. ''You know why God made economists?'' Mr. Kasich asked. &quot;To make astrologers look accurate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And in a state that should be comfortable turf for a Republican governor from Ohio, Mr. Kasich picked up at least one friend: Neil Sheridan, the chief executive of a management consulting company, who attended the lunchtime event. ''He has a good jobs record, and it wouldn't hurt to have a Midwestern voice in the White House,'' said Mr. Sheridan, who was undecided before Mr. Kasich spoke, but later gave the governor his business card and offered to volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To which Mr. Kasich asked, ''How many people do you know?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DERRY, N.H. --  On his first day as a full-fledged, no-longer-just-thinking-about-it candidate for president, Jeb Bush called his adopted hometown Miami ''a crazy, wacky place.'' He spoke of the trauma of discovering that a hacker had published personal emails he had written about the health of his father. He gave a long, emotional hug to a woman who told of her decades-long struggle with mental disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he confessed to a rookie error. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Grabbing back the microphone after wrapping up an event here, Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor -- who has not held public office in eight years -- asked for a do-over. ''I blew it,'' he said, before revealing his mistake: He had somehow forgotten to ask his audience to vote for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unencumbered by the artifice and awkwardness entailed in not quite campaigning for the last six months, Mr. Bush on Tuesday seemed a different kind of presidential candidate: disarmingly playful and noticeably relaxed, quick to joke and eager to connect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he spoke at a town hall-style meeting here, he noticed that a young woman he had met earlier in the day -- who had complained about her crippling student-loan debt and ill-advised psychology major in college -- was sneaking out of the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As she neared the door, Mr. Bush mischievously singled her out. ''You've left!'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sorry,'' she replied, ''got to work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush's wry response: ''Well, I'm glad you got a job.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The audience erupted into laughter and applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of those who queried Mr. Bush was a woman with developmental disabilities who told Mr. Bush that ''doctors told my mother to put me away.'' Instead, she said, her mother refused, and the woman now holds down a job helping children like her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before she had even asked her question, Mr. Bush walked over and gave her a firm hug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The limits people may have,'' he told her, ''pale by comparison to the joy they can bring.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were, of course, a few beginner's mistakes. Struggling to summon the right nickname for New Hampshire residents, whose first-in-the-nation primary has long been a source of pride, Mr. Bush simply made up a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''New Hampshire-ites, Granite State folks -- whatever you guys want to call yourself,'' he said, to laughs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (The elusive phrase is ''Granite Staters.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush stood on his feet for close to an hour, surrounded by about 50 people, perspiring in the heat but appearing at ease and nimble as he engaged with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When a middle-aged man asked about the size of America's debt and suggested that most of it was held by China and Japan, Mr. Bush could not resist a small, pedantic correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Just a nerdy point on the last statement.,'' Mr. Bush began, then said that, in fact, the Federal Reserve was now the largest holder of United States debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A cerebral policy maven, Mr. Bush has often seemed more at ease dissecting data with think-tank scholars than fielding oddball queries from voters, and he has sometimes struggled to find his niche in a field crammed with capable campaigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, he acknowledged as much. ''You know, we have a lot of people who are really good at talking -- much better than me,'' Mr. Bush said in a moment of intriguing insecurity. ''I wish I could talk as well as some of the people I see on TV.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But inside the Adams Memorial Opera House here, there were glimmers of a Mr. Bush who, with time, could hold his own against his party's most talented talkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Boasting about his record of job creation in Florida, Mr. Bush trotted out a new line of attack that touched on his own family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you see my good friend Rick Perry, or even my brother, George W. Bush, tell them we created more jobs than Texas,'' said Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush wielded his dry humor over and over on Tuesday. During an interview at the opera house with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, Mr. Bush chuckled when asked about criticism from Donald Trump, who is now a candidate for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sorry,'' Mr. Bush quickly said of his laughter. But he did not seem sorry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With little prompting, he offered brief and sometimes tart descriptions of his Republican rivals in the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Real Texan,'' he said of Gov. Rick Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Fighter,'' he said of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Rich guy,'' he said of Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would &quot;probably not&quot; vote for fast-track authority for the trade deal that President Obama is seeking, but she acknowledged that she once said positive things about &quot;the potential&quot; for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton made the comments in an interview with Jon Ralston, a Nevada journalist, after spending Thursday in the state, which holds early caucuses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, who has not taken a yes-or-no position on the trade deal, which is strongly opposed by labor groups, is in a bind over an agreement she once praised as a potential &quot;gold standard&quot; for trade deals when she was secretary of state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I said positive things about the process and the potential,&quot; said Mrs. Clinton, who occasionally called Mr. Ralston &quot;Joe&quot; during the interview. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people don't like any trade agreement, and some people are willing to take any trade agreement,&quot; she said. Asked whether she would vote in favor of fast-track authority  if she were still in the Senate, Mrs. Clinton replied, &quot;Probably not, because that's a process vote, and I don't want to say that's the same as T.P.P.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton has been criticized for not taking a clear position on the issue since becoming a candidate. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, indicated this week that trade deals, on balance, tend to work, a position consistent with his views when he was president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton also spoke again about the shooting death of nine people at a black church in South Carolina; a 21-year-old white man, allegedly fueled by racial hatred, is accused of opening fire after sitting through a prayer study. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to have a candid national conversation about race and about discrimination, prejudice, hatred,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said.  &quot;Unfortunately the public discourse is sometimes hotter and more negative than it should be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then turned her comments to Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul who, in kicking off his presidential campaign this week, accused Mexico of allowing rapists and other criminals to sneak into the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without naming Mr. Trump, she said that a recent candidate had &quot;said some very inflammatory things about Mexicans - you don't talk like that&quot; in political campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he is emblematic,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's another culprit, she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's just cut to the chase - it's guns. We have to have a better balance,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton noted that there was widespread support for background checks for gun buyers, but that Congress had failed to act &quot;in the face of tremendous pressure from the gun lobby.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she witnessed it first-hand when her husband fought for the assault weapons ban as president in the 1990s. She did not say whether she would now support such a measure herself. An  assault weapons ban is far more politically contentious than background checks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Donald J. Trump arrived on an escalator and announced on Tuesday that he would seek the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he set off a gold rush among late-night comedians who could not wait to satirize his bombastic, digressive declaration speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Comedy Central's ''The Daily Show,'' Jon Stewart gave thanks to the heavens, while on NBC's ''Late Night,'' Seth Meyers presented a point-by-point takedown of Mr. Trump's immoderate campaign promises. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, in an online video, Stephen Colbert performed his own version of the speech, offering his mock support. (Describing Mr. Trump as someone who looks like ''they raked his body out of the surf down in Cape May,'' Mr. Colbert said, in an unplaceable, Trump-like accent, ''That sends a message of confidence to voters that if you vote for him, he's not physically dead.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there is a crucial difference between Mr. Colbert and his comedic peers: He is not appearing on television and won't be until Sept. 8, when he will take over as host of CBS's ''Late Show,'' succeeding David Letterman, who stepped down from that program in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the meantime, Mr. Colbert, who ended his Comedy Central series, ''The Colbert Report,'' in December, has been offering a steady flow of content as if he were already on the air at CBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the help of the Internet, Mr. Colbert and his ''Late Show'' collaborators are hoping to preserve the host's connection to his fans, develop the voice of their new program and keep pace with their late-night competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Mr. Colbert explained in an email, ''We like our audience and want to give them gifts to let them know we miss them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rob Dubbin, a writer for Mr. Colbert's ''Late Show'' and its producer of digital entertainment, said in an interview: ''The last I heard, we were still planning to do a show. We're as anxious to get back to it as people seem to be to receive it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Dubbin added that the goal of any preproduction period was ''figuring things out'' and that these digital creations were ''a cool way to share the results of that process as they occur.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Following a hiatus of almost six months, Mr. Colbert re-emerged earlier this month by introducing several new online offerings created to support his ''Late Show'' debut, including an official website; Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accounts; and an iOS application called Colbr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to a weekly podcast, ''The Late Show'' has posted new videos every few days, offering updates that are both factual (the hiring of its bandleader, Jon Batiste) and farcical (Mr. Colbert shaving off the beard he grew during his downtime).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Opus Moreschi, a ''Late Show'' head writer and supervising producer, said that videos like the Trump parody allowed Mr. Colbert and his staff to continue their mission of ''making light of things and enjoying the insanity of the world around us'' in a spontaneous and real-time way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Moreschi said that on Tuesday he and his colleagues had been watching Mr. Trump's speech on TV at the temporary offices of ''The Late Show,'' above a BMW dealership on Manhattan's West Side, while they await renovations to their permanent home at the Ed Sullivan Theater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We were enjoying the pace and the rhythm and his clear lack of preparation so much,'' Mr. Moreschi said, ''that before Trump was done talking, we were working on it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Flags and drapery were obtained, extras were hired, and the video was recorded in a conference room that afternoon and posted online that night. (It has already received more than one million views on YouTube.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Colbert is hardly the first late-night host to appreciate that digital vitality is crucial to the overall success of his show. Online videos and other web content have become the lifeblood of programs like NBC's ''Tonight'' show and ABC's ''Jimmy Kimmel Live,'' where entertainers like Jimmy Fallon and Mr. Kimmel have years of experience as hosts of network shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're not trying to create memes or viral videos,'' Mr. Moreschi added. ''We're not trying to hashtag-trend. We're just doing our comedy, whether it's on the Internet or a big old dumb box in the middle of the living room.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as Mr. Colbert prepares for ''The Late Show,'' he must determine how to broaden his appeal beyond the audience he reached on basic cable, and how he will present himself when he is no longer the fatuous pundit character he played for 10 seasons on ''The Colbert Report.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These online experiments give Mr. Colbert some breathing room to try out his new network persona -- a cultured quipster not unlike his actual self -- without having to do so in front of the wider and more critical audience he will face in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If people watched the old show, they know Stephen's sense of humor, and that's who he is,'' Mr. Moreschi said. ''The character he's playing now is a talk-show host whose job it is to entertain you. It's freeing. We don't have to think about why our character would want to go do something -- he can just do it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recalling his original job for Mr. Colbert, which required him to write in the voice of a fictional webmaster for the ''Colbert Report'' site, Mr. Dubbin said: ''It was speculative fiction, imagining that the show had a following. Our expectations were pretty low.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That show felt experimental every day,'' Mr. Dubbin said of ''The Colbert Report.'' ''Two years in. Seven years in. On the last day. I hope it doesn't ever stop feeling experimental.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good Monday morning from Washington. Though trade is still a source of gamesmanship and huge Supreme Court decisions could come down at any moment, all eyes are on Charleston, S.C., where crowds on Sunday spilled out of the church in which nine black churchgoers were killed on Wednesday by a white gunman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it were up to most of the Republican presidential candidates, the campaign would be centered on what they perceive as President Obama's shortcomings, the threat of Islamic terrorism and questions about Hillary Rodham Clinton's ethics. But instead, the next few weeks are likely to be dominated by a host of issues that will test their ability to balance the competing demands of conservative primary voters and the general electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there was Pope Francis' encyclical on the threat of climate change, which thrust into the campaign a topic that many Republicans have sought to dodge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came last week's massacre of nine people at a black church in Charleston, S.C., which has prompted difficult questions about gun violence, racial discrimination and the displaying of the Confederate flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if that was not enough to put them on the defensive, now comes the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule in the next two weeks on two cases likely to create a new round of difficult questions for the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the matter of how to replace the health insurance of millions of Americans who could lose their coverage if the court strikes down the part of Affordable Care Act that provides subsidies to individuals in states that rely on the federal insurance marketplace. And there is the prospect that the court could effectively legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, prompting the question of whether (and how) the Republican candidates would fight such a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sports, this is called playing an away game. These issues do not make up the terrain on which Republicans wish to contest this election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Watching This Week </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the week that Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana is expected to add his name to the long list of Republican presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates who are senators - Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, all Republicans, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democrat, will be tied up in Washington for much of the week. Mrs. Clinton will be in Virginia on Friday, while also late in the week, Mr. Cruz, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Donald J. Trump will be in Iowa, as will Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, who will make his first visit to the state, despite not quite being a candidate yet, to in part gauge its interest in him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid tensions between the United States and China over the cybertheft of personal information from 14 million federal workers, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and Secretary of State John Kerry will host the seventh United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, through Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let the Trade Negotiations Continue. Again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade is back in the Senate's court as advocates and the White House push this week to finish the difficult fight before lawmakers head out of town for a Fourth of July recess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the House passed legislation last week giving Mr. Obama fast-track negotiating authority, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the majority leader, set up a series of votes that he hopes will end with the president signing both the fast-track bill and a second measure granting training and other benefits to workers displaced by overseas competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As always in the contentious trade maneuvering, there are some wrinkles. Mr. McConnell needs Democrats who initially supported the trade deal in the Senate last month to back it again. But in the previous go-round, the negotiating power and the worker aid were tied together, making it easier for Democrats. Now, they will be considered separately, and some Democrats are saying they aren't sure they can back a deal structured that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That position gives Democrats added leverage to extract more concessions from Republicans on the worker assistance, but Republicans seem to think they have already been generous and may balk at further sweetening the package. The critical vote on the arrangement could come as early as Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with all the jockeying, pro-trade forces believe they are on their way to success despite another push by labor to block the legislation. But Mr. McConnell acknowledged that a trade victory was going to require a little trust on the part of Republicans and Democrats, a commodity in short supply on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Carl Hulse  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supreme Court Is Down to Its Final Mondays </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court enters the term's home stretch on Monday, with 11 decisions yet to come. The blockbusters on same-sex marriage and health care are not likely to be among those announced when the justices take the bench at 10 a.m. More likely are ones on lethal injections, housing discrimination and whether the Constitution allows independent commissions rather than state legislatures to draw voting districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is only one more day scheduled for the court to issue decisions: Monday, June 29. But the court is likely to add one or two more days this week, and there is a possibility that the term will end on Tuesday, June 30. One potential calendar: health care next Monday and same-sex marriage the day after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Adam Liptak </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bipartisan Proposals to Address Criminal Justice Overhaul </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coalition for Public Safety, the strange-bedfellows alliance of progressives and conservatives over criminal justice overhaul, is set on Monday to issue policy recommendations aimed at reducing the national prison population and making it easier for those released from prison to start over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposals are expected to include reducing mandatory minimum penalties, allowing judges more discretion in sentencing, expanding alternatives to incarceration, reducing education and employment barriers to former offenders, increasing federal hiring, improving accuracy of criminal background checks, and allowing low-level offenders to erase criminal records after a period of good conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition has muscle from conservatives and liberals, who have found common ground on the idea that America's criminal justice system has become too reliant on incarceration, even for nonviolent offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups represented in Monday's announcement include the conservative Americans for Tax Reform and the progressive American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for American Progress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Obama played golf over the weekend on emerald courses in California, bringing himself into the state's debate over its severe drought and water-use restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for Father's Day, some of the 2016 presidential candidates and hopefuls have been telling the tales of their fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Reading Elsewhere </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post takes a look at the state flags bearing symbols of the Confederacy, and notes that, according to census data, &quot;roughly one-third of the nation's black population lives under a state flag that evokes&quot; such images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And writing about the man accused of the Charleston shooting, The Guardian reports, &quot;The leader of a right-wing group that Dylann Roof allegedly credits with helping to radicalise him against black people before the Charleston church massacre has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republicans such as presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Rick Santorum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Clinton may have gotten a lot of buzz for basing her campaign in Brooklyn, but she continues to do most of her New York-based work at her Manhattan offices, and her team just signed a new lease there, Politico reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post's fact checker calls out Mr. Paul for vastly overstating things in citing a man who was imprisoned for 10 years for putting dirt on his property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meet the Press&quot; was criticized by some on Sunday for showing a video segment of black prisoners talking about their gun crimes on the same episode that discussed the Charleston shooting. The segment, which the host Chuck Todd said was decided upon before the shootings, was called insensitive, at best, by some critics. The Hill reports.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good Tuesday morning from Washington. The conversation after the shooting in Charleston, S.C.,almost immediately turned to the Confederate flag, which the gunman embraced in online postings and which hung at the state's Capitol. On Monday, Gov. Nikki R. Haley called for it to come down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Confederate battle flag is poised to fall from South Carolina's Capitol, with popular support gathering from Republicans in the state and around the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as opposition to the symbol solidifies beyond South Carolina, it is increasingly unlikely that the flag will continue to fly much longer beyond the walls of museums and Civil War battlefields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acceptance of the Confederate flag has been waning for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flag was featured on two separate occasions in Georgia's state flag before ultimately being removed. Last year, California moved to ban sales of merchandise with the flag logo. And last week, the Supreme Court ruled that Texas hadn't violated the First Amendment when it refused to allow license plates bearing the flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can't be rubbed out of our history, but it ought to be confined to its historical context,&quot; said James McPherson, a Civil War historian at Princeton University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Republicans have treaded carefully over the flag issue in the past, many, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said on Monday that it was time to retire a symbol that pains so many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mississippi, which features the Confederate logo in its state flag, might be next to fall. Thousands of petitioners have come in response to the outrage in South Carolina, but Republican lawmakers in the state have been resistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, Democrats seem pleased that the flag might finally be history, but they remain steadfast that furling the flag does not co-opt other pressing issues, like gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just the beginning of a conversation we as a society need to have about race, bigotry and violence in this country - not the end of one,&quot; said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend a community meeting at a church in Florissant, Mo., to discuss the Charleston shooting and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donald J. Trump, who made his campaign official on Monday by filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, will hold a campaign event in Baltimore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the White House will host a climate change and health summit meeting, which will include video remarks from President Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bulletins: Battle Lines Drawn From Super PACs to Third-Party Groups </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;super PAC&quot; founded by an ally of Mrs. Clinton  is planning to invest heavily in efforts to tie Republican candidates to the Koch brothers, oil tycoons whom Democrats have maligned in the last three national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third-party groups have sued the Federal Election Commission to open the debates, which they say are made impossible to enter unless a candidate is a Republican or a Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Final Bell Seems Ready to Ring in Trade Fight  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate is set to take yet another critical trade vote on Tuesday, and it appears likely that pro-trade lawmakers will muster the 60 votes needed to clear the way for approval - again - of special fast-track negotiating power for Mr. Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crucial Democrats such as Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the party's senior member on the Finance Committee, are expected to support the approval of the trade power without tying it directly to aid for workers who lose their jobs because of new imports. The vote on that element of the trade deal will come later in the week if the initial bill passes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade legislation first passed the Senate in late May with a few votes to spare. That cushion means that not all of the 14 Democrats who backed it the last time need to do so again, particularly since the measure could pick up a few Republicans who didn't vote for it. Plus, those Democrats who earlier backed the trade power, fiercely opposed by progressives and organized labor, are already on record defying those groups. Voting against it this time probably won't heal those wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a long and emotional fight, but it appears to be nearing an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Carl Hulse </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Favorites From Today's Times </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Clinton has embraced racial issues head on in her campaign so far, and how they have shaped her approach has emerged as the most striking difference between her 2016 campaign and the failed bid of 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Obama, who has been showing more emotion recently than he is known for, spoke with the comedian Marc Maron on his podcast, noting that racism in the United States is &quot;still part of our DNA.&quot;And the White House announced on Monday that Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would attend the funeral on Friday of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was killed in the Charleston shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earl Holt III, the leader of a white supremacist group that is thought to have influenced the suspect in the shooting, donated money to several Republican candidates, who have said they would either return the money or give it to charity. And now the group, which in recent years seemed in decline, has been thrust back onto the national stage and has embroiled the Republican Party in new questions about its ties to the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Reading Elsewhere </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post looks inside the efforts of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin to lay a foundation for his eventual presidential run, saying that his &quot;$20 million push&quot; has included a contrast that &quot;highlights the central challenge Walker faces as he prepares to formally begin his campaign next month: how to expand his aw-shucks, socially conservative Midwestern appeal to the broader Republican Party and to the rest of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Wall Street Journal and NBC poll suggests that Mrs. Clinton has a &quot;firm grip&quot; on the Democratic nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But speaking on Fox News, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island and one of Mrs. Clinton's competitors, sought to dispute any notions that she was destined to be the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Texas secessionist movement has gotten support in, of all places, Russia, where anger still lingers over perceived American support for the breakup of the Soviet Union, Politico reports.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This carpet is garbage,'' muttered one of 20-odd photographers last week at the ceremonial entrance to the Fragrance Foundation Awards (long known as the FiFis, like a disobedient poodle, though that nickname is now discouraged by its public-relations team, in the interest of gravitas). Many famous people have represented scents in one capacity or another. But only a smattering can be persuaded to attend the perfume industry's most important annual event, its ultimate prize, its Oscars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a world where ''juice'' is not the stuff of an overpriced diet plan, or something your phone is running out of, but an elaborately packaged potion of seduction and gateway drug to many brands, be they Maison Martin Margiela or Taylor Swift. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Swift, a nominee for Incredible Things, a collaboration with Elizabeth Arden, didn't show. But inside Alice Tully Hall, Behati Prinsloo, a golden-haired Victoria's Secret Angel from Namibia, was interrupted during the cocktail hour while eating a miniature hamburger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I can't really talk about any fragrances,'' she said, alluding vaguely to business negotiations. ''I'm just in the midst of stuff, so it's hard. Listen, my first fragrance was Charlie, I know that! My favorite smell is my grandmother's home-cooked food.'' Appearing to receive instructions over his headset, a nearby publicist made cut-it-off motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On to a friendlier subject. Johnny Weir, the asymmetrically coifed Olympic figure skater, dressed in a rubber-topped white ensemble by Moto Guo, a Malaysian designer: froth in a sea of little black dresses. ''You know why that is?'' he said of the generally conservative attire. ''It's Wednesday night.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But to Mr. Weir it felt like the splashiest of Saturdays. ''I've been a fan of fragrance since I was little,'' he said. ''My first cologne was Obsession by Calvin Klein. When I was 13, I was obsessed with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While singular perfumes like Obsession used to dominate, with their memorable TV ads, according to the foundation's president, Elizabeth Musmanno, the business is increasingly ... atomized? Diffused? Still, ''it's a nice pillar that can hold up a house,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though he was a ''face'' of MAC Cosmetics, Mr. Weir does not yet have a 'fume of his own. ''I would be a disaster in those meetings,'' he said. ''I would just say: 'I want something powdery!' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When pressed, he suggested: ''It would be unisex, it would be clean, with just a hint of a clean man's scent.'' What about a name? ''Probably Ice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spritz! Sniff!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The actor Zachary Quinto, of ''Star Trek,'' was poring over notes for his speech to present the fragrance of the year in the men's luxury category, bouncing on the sneakers he wore with his skinny suit. Asked how the heck he came to be there, he answered a little defensively, ''I wear fragrance.'' In high school, patchouli oil; currently, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Malle, Comme des Gar&ccedil;ons Blue Santal and a woman's one that he preferred to keep private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think it's an important part of the creative process, certainly,'' Mr. Quinto said of smell. ''It's one of our strongest senses, the most evocative of memory. I just remember those Elizabeth Taylor fragrances. Was it Passion? White Diamonds. Real mom, grandma, teacher stuff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was a sudden surge into the auditorium: Kendall Jenner, who models for Est&eacute;e Lauder, had arrived, and Alec Baldwin, the master of ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Baldwin began by announcing that his wife, Hilaria Thomas Baldwin, a yoga teacher, had given birth to their son, Rafael, at 1:30 that morning. ''And when you think about it, a fragrance is probably responsible for that baby, wouldn't you say so?'' he said. ''My wife was wearing some kind of special fragrance and whoa, watch out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The blessed occasion did not diminish Mr. Baldwin's profanity. He made jokes about ''President Trump''; about being thrown into Mecox Bay while flying to the Hamptons on Tommy Hilfiger's private plane; about how Linda Evangelista's well-known statement that she wouldn't get out of bed for less than $10,000 needed to be adjusted for inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Evangelista, a chairwoman of the event, presented the fragrance of the year in the men's and women's prestige categories: Dior Homme, for men, and Giorgio Armani, for women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dior also cleaned up the media-campaign awards for both sexes, thanks in part to footage of a fierce-looking Charlize Theron scaling a silk scarf. The perfume it advertised, J'adore, was also welcomed to the organization's hall of fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Kendall, I just want some of your 48 million followers,'' Mr. Baldwin said, venturing into the audience and taking a selfie with Ms. Jenner, Ellen DeGeneres-style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Herm&egrave;s, Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford (who beamed in from the London men's fashion shows to honor his mentor, John Demsey, the group president of the Est&eacute;e Lauder Companies) also won multiple awards, along with the independent perfumer By Kilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Annie Buzantian, who has created scents for corporations including Armani and Victoria's Secret and (lest you think this is all crass consumerism) cited Paganini and Tennyson as inspirations, was honored for lifetime achievement. ''Her nose is so good she can smell Donald Trump's hair from here,'' Mr. Baldwin said, relentless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were 22 categories in total, causing at least one tuxedoed company man to shift in his seat and say he wished he were home watching ''Real Housewives.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After most of the sinuous abstract statuettes had been handed out, the singer Bryan Adams arrived onstage to belt out ''Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?'' and ''Summer of '69.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The audience then filed back into the lobby for a dinner of asparagus, quail eggs, shavings of truffle, filet mignon and lobster potpie. Cooling herself Karl Lagerfeld-ishly with a paper fan, Ms. Evangelista said she is a big fan of white flowers. ''I want to be an old lady,'' she said a little wistfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Smell her!'' the hairdresser Sally Hershberger commanded, standing on tiptoe and thrusting her nose into the crook of Ms. Evangelista's neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At an adjacent table, the designer Prabal Gurung was sitting with the junior miss Kiernan Shipka, late of ''Mad Men,'' in one of his pretty embroidered dresses. And what fragrance was she wearing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Nothing!'' Ms. Shipka exclaimed, faintly surprised. ''I'm not wearing any perfume at all.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gurung said, ''It's just our auras.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In Virginia, Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked her Republican presidential rivals for resisting stricter gun controls and opposing the Supreme Court&amp;#8217;s recognition of same-sex marriage. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAIRFAX, Va. - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday night berated her Republican presidential rivals for protesting the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage and for resisting stricter gun laws after the shooting that killed nine churchgoers in Charleston, S.C..</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting on what she called &quot;an emotional roller-coaster of a day,&quot; Mrs. Clinton lauded the 5-to-4 decision recognizing same-sex marriage and renewed her calls for &quot;common sense&quot; gun control. But she saved her strongest words for criticizing the Republican contenders, who she said &quot;seemed determined to lead us right back into the past&quot; on those and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of trying to turn back the clock, they should be joining us in saying loudly and clearly saying no - no to discrimination, once and for all,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said. &quot;I am asking them, please, don't make the rights, the hopes of any American into a political football for this 2016 campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the court's decision Friday morning, several Republican presidential hopefuls, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, called for a constitutional amendment allowing states to define marriage as they wish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, who has repeatedly argued for &quot;common sense&quot; gun control measures since the shootings last week, also drew attention to a vote by the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday against an amendment that would have channeled increased funding to the Centers of Disease Control to study gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can you watch massacre after massacre and take that vote?&quot; Mrs. Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She proceeded to critique the Republicans systematically on a long list of issues, from the Affordable Care Act to climate change to women's reproductive health, and without using his name, again rebuked Donald J. Trump for referring to Mexican immigrants in his campaign announcement speech this week as rapists and criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton opened her speech, though, by addressing the court's same-sex marriage ruling directly. She called it a triumph for love, equality and the country, and read aloud the concluding portion of the court's majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's decision confirms we've been working toward equality as a nation, step by step, case by case, court by court, and that equality has been right there in the Constitution all along,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said. &quot;There is something quite remarkable about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her remarks came before the Democratic Party of Virginia's annual Jefferson Jackson Dinner at George Mason University here. Before taking the stage, she spent the afternoon in Charleston, where she attended the funeral of Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a state senator and the pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, who was killed there along with eight others in a mass shooting last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton's visit to Virginia was the first since declaring her candidacy in April. It is also one of her first campaign events outside the early primary states. She has close ties to Democrats in the state, but Virginia is expected to be hotly contested in 2016.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering it enters students in our Sixth Annual Summer Reading Contest, for which we choose weekly favorites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below,  Bryson W.'s  winning essay from our first week, on Caitlyn Jenner, Rachel Dolezal and attempts to label identities in &quot;airtight boxes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've also posted a list of runners-up and honorable mentions, which we'll continue to do all summer long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students impressed us with their thoughtfulness and with the variety of pieces they selected - from science fiction to student loans and smoking in China. But without a doubt, Caitlyn Jenner and transgender rights stood out as the most popular topics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for participating, and, remember, any teenager anywhere in the world can enter any week by writing about anything that appeared in The Times in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winner </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Misguided-ness Inherent in Every Attempt to Establish Airtight Boxes of Self, by Bryson W.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a progressive millennial, I recently celebrated Caitlyn Jenner's transition from Bruce Jenner to transgender icon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet reading about Rachel Dolezal this week, I have found myself struggling to answer a question posed by the conservative blogosphere: If a man can feel female on the inside, why can't a white and Native American woman such as Ms. Dolezal identify as black because she feels that way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the question's intent was snarky, intended to highlight the hypocrisy of the Left and the folly of transgender individuals, it did give me pause. Like gender, race is both a biological and social construct. Isn't it possible that Ms. Dolezal, who has an adopted black brother, identifies with a race that is not her biological one?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ms. Dolezal should not have lied about her race, she is in the end a victim of the same society that has made Caitlyn Jenner an anomaly. As we wade deeper into the murkiness surrounding affirmative action, transgender rights, and a myriad identity issues, it becomes clearer that we must acknowledge the misguidedness inherent in every attempt to establish airtight boxes of self. Characterizations that leave no room for ambiguity will inevitably leave some out - whether it is Ms. Jenner or Ms. Donezal or even Miley Cyrus, who said in May that she views herself as genderqueer. Until we shift our perceptions of identity, Ms. Jenner and Ms. Dolezal will not be the last to fall victim to labels. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Republican field of presidential candidates continues to grow, the nominating contest in Iowa becomes more muddled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin continues to lead the pack, according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University. The Republican from neighboring Wisconsin has the support of 18 percent of potential caucus-goers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa is closely watched because it represents the start of presidential primary season and can give a candidate significant momentum as the race gathers pace. The caucus also has, in the past, provided a lift to more conservative candidates, handing victories to Rick Santorum in 2012 and Mike Huckabee in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker has been working to burnish his conservative credentials in the hope of appealing to Iowans, but the poll shows his strength in the state has diminished somewhat as more candidates have entered the race. In a February survey, he had support of a quarter of those who might participate in the caucuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond Mr. Walker, however, things are murky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. Trump, the billionaire businessman who is under fire for inflammatory remarks about Mexican immigrants, is tied for second place with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, with support of 10 percent of possible caucus-goers. Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are close behind at 9 percent, and former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio, both of Florida, follow at 8 percent and 7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, former Mr. Huckabee, the 2008 caucus winner, is languishing with 5 percent and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who announced his candidacy on Tuesday, is at 1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As even more candidates toss their hats into the ring, the race has gotten even more muddled,&quot; said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac's poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Mr. Trump's high standing in the poll, more than a quarter of Iowans say they would never support him. Mr. Bush is close behind in that category, with 24 percent saying &quot;no way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown suggested that party leaders in the state are concerned that Mr. Trump could be a disruptive force in the caucus process. There has also been frustration that Mr. Bush has not spent enough time in the state, diminishing its importance to the nominating process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has joined the Republican presidential field. Here is a look at what he will need to do to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JONATHAN MARTIN </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Coalition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Christie's voters are likely to come from the moderate wing of the Republican Party. While he opposes abortion rights, he has little natural connection to Christian conservatives. He is better suited to the business community and party activists who find his pugnacity appealing. A Christie voter is somebody who appreciates tough talk -- but not tough talk about, say, unseating Supreme Court justices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Map</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Christie's hopes begin -- and could end -- in New Hampshire. He is counting on fellow Northeasterners to warm to him the way they have taken to other presidential candidates who have a tell-it-like-it-is image. But he is hardly the only Republican relying on the state's famously flinty voters to vault him into contention. If he does manage to win New Hampshire, he could emerge as a strong rival to candidates with similar followings, like Jeb Bush, as the race shifts to South Carolina and Nevada. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Message</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Christie wants Republican voters to believe he is not only offering hard truths, but doing so on some of the nation's most nettlesome challenges, like social programs and education. A secondary message to Republicans hungry to recapture the White House is that he won twice in a heavily Democratic state, did so with a multiracial coalition and could do nationally what he did in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why He Will Win</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Few politicians can match Mr. Christie's charisma and knack for give-and-take. His skills are not to be found in a briefing book. He is particularly well suited for New Hampshire's tradition of freewheeling town halls. If he can also put together a few successful turns in televised debates, he could vault into contention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why He Won't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Christie's politicking routine is compelling, but if it ultimately seems to be about him, and not the voters, his talent will be for naught. New Jersey has soured on him, more Republicans say they would not consider supporting him than any other candidate except Donald J. Trump, and he is not finding anywhere near the financial support he expected to secure after his landslide 2013 re-election. His political base in the New York-New Jersey area and his penchant for sound bites will earn him more attention than other also-rans, but will move few primary voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he left office as governor of Florida, Jeb Bush's net worth grew to at least $19 million from $1.3 million, a significant leap in wealth that reflects the power of his connections and the breadth of his entrepreneurial pursuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush and his wife, Columba, reported $28.5 million in adjusted gross income from 2007, the year he left office, through 2013, according to tax returns he released on Tuesday. Nearly $10 million came from his speaking engagements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bushes' income topped out at $7.3 million in 2013, the last of 33 years of returns he made public. The return showed that they paid $2.9 million in federal taxes on that income, for an effective tax rate of 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush's disclosure of voluminous financial records comes early in a presidential campaign that has elevated the issue of candidates' wealth, and the way it may distance them from ordinary Americans in an era of economic uncertainty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After he left state politics eight years ago, Mr. Bush made clear that he wanted to make money. The mystery was just how much he had made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bush campaign reported that the couple's total net worth is now between $19 million and $22 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The wealth of America's political dynasties is emerging as a major theme of the 2016 campaign. And while the fortune amassed by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton dwarfs what Mr. Bush collected, the records show that he similarly had little difficulty leveraging his prominent name to gain millions of dollars in the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush said his wealth has also allowed for significant charitable contributions. The couple reported $110,616 in donations on their 2013 return. In a statement on his website, Mr. Bush said they donated $739,000 to charity from 2007 to 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm proud of what Columba and I have contributed,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The effective tax rate of 40 percent that Mr. Bush paid compares with the 13.9 percent rate that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, reported paying in 2010, a figure that drew widespread criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The release of the returns, 16 months before the general election, is intended to position Mr. Bush as particularly open to scrutiny compared with other candidates. It included filings for several years that had previously been disclosed during his campaigns for governor. The Bush campaign said he has requested extensions for filing his 2014 taxes and his financial disclosure report, which will include details of his assets and liabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Deep in the 2013 filing, he reported $5.8 million in ''consulting and speaking'' income. Separately, Mr. Bush's campaign provided details of his engagements showing that he delivered about 260 paid speeches from 2007 to the present, for which he earned a total of $9.95 million. He listed 10 speeches at the Poongsan Corporation, a South Korea-based copper manufacturer that has long ties to the Bush family. His most recent audiences included the National Automobile Dealers Association and the American Council of Life Insurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The campaign did not release details of the income from his consulting engagements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the early going of the 2016 campaign, the candidates' financial and business affairs have drawn particular scrutiny. Their wealth can be seen as a double-edged sword, signifying both financial acumen but also socioeconomic distance from most voters at a time when income inequality is a pressing issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the field of candidates, Mrs. Clinton disclosed in May that she and her husband had made at least $30 million since the start of 2014, largely from giving paid speeches. Senator Marco Rubio reported that he cashed out a retirement account last year. And in June, as he announced his candidacy, Donald Trump held up a document showing his net worth to be around $8.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush and his wife have paid a higher tax rate than many fellow millionaires because most of his earnings come in the form of wages and salaries, instead of investment income, which is often taxed at a lower rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One thing is obvious,'' said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and a former staff economist in Congress, who took a cursory look at the returns. ''Compared to many people in his income range, Jeb Bush clearly has less capital gains income, and therefore has a higher effective individual income tax rate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For several years, Mr. Bush, 62, has used an office at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Fla., working closely with his son, Jeb Jr., while consulting, giving speeches and managing a private investment business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of his endeavors included serving as a paid director to the hospital company Tenet Healthcare, which backed President Obama's Affordable Care Act. The position invited questions for Mr. Bush, who as a candidate opposes the health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush profited handsomely from his Tenet shares. According to the newly released tax returns, Mr. Bush acquired $441,203 worth of stock in Tenet Healthcare in May 2011. The stock doubled in value by the time he sold it in October 2013, earning him a profit of $462,013 in just 29 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like other hospital stocks, Tenet rose sharply from October 2012 through March 2013, when President Obama's re-election made it likely that the health care law would be carried out. The law was considered a boon for hospitals because it was expected to increase business and reduce the expense of caring for uninsured patients who could not pay their bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bush resigned from the Tenet board in 2014 when he was preparing for his presidential campaign, and this year sold off his stakes in his two remaining businesses as he contemplated a run for the presidency. He sold his consultancy, Jeb Bush &amp; Associates, to his son and business partner, Jeb Jr., while also shedding his interest in the Britton Hill entities, a group of private investment and advisory firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His other high-profile and controversial engagements have included working as a paid adviser to Lehman Brothers, an appointment that included seeking an investment in 2008 in the failing bank from Carlos Slim Hel&uacute;, a Mexican billionaire. Mr. Bush also consulted for the building materials manufacturer InnoVida, which went bankrupt and whose founder pleaded guilty to fraud charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tax forms also trace the period in the 1980s and 1990s when Mr. Bush, then a young entrepreneur, was building his own political base in South Florida. He told a reporter at the time, ''I want to be very wealthy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The returns showed that his average adjusted gross income was about $400,000 over the 18 years before he became governor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's biggest Spanish-language broadcaster on Thursday filed to go public, seeking new investors as its target audience continues to grow in size and power.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In its prospectus, Univision noted that Hispanics now make up more than 17 percent of the total population of the United States, having accounted for more than half of the country's population growth over the last five years. The broadcaster also cited projections that Hispanics' buying power will rise from $1.3 trillion last year to $1.7 trillion in 2019.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Essentially founded in 1992, when the businessman Jerry Perenchio led a group that bought the Univision Network from Hallmark Cards, the company grew to become a dominant force within Spanish-language media. Its empire now encompasses its namesake channel, as well as Galavisi&oacute;n; the sports network Univision Deportes, as well as an array of local radio and digital outlets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The planned stock sale also comes as Univision is embroiled in a fight with Donald J. Trump after dropping its forthcoming broadcast of the Miss USA pageant over his denouncing Mexican immigrants as ''rapists'' and ''murderers'' in the kickoff for his presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has sued the media company for $500 million, accusing it of violating a five-year broadcasting contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet when Univision finally begins trading on the public stock markets, under the ticker symbol ''UVN,'' the company's current owners are unlikely to celebrate too loudly. Those financial investors -- a consortium that includes the billionaire Haim Saban and the private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG and THL Partners -- paid $13.7 billion for the network in 2007, at the height of the leveraged buyout boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such was the interest in Univision that the Saban group battled fiercely with rival suitors, in the form of a partnership that included Grupo Televisa, Bain Capital and the investment firm for Bill Gates's personal fortune. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But since then, the company has taken on the dubious distinction of being a private equity investment that has been tough to exit, alongside other megadeals like Clear Channel Communications. Last year, Univision's owners held preliminary sales discussions with a host of potential suitors, including CBS, Viacom and Time Warner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another potential bidder has been Grupo Televisa, the Latin American media producer that supplies much of Univision's content and already owns a roughly 5 percent stake. But federal broadcasting regulations prohibit a foreign company from owning more than 25 percent of a broadcaster, though exemptions can be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So important is the relationship with Televisa, however, that the two companies announced an extension of their business relationship on Thursday. That contract will now continue to 2030, and Televisa will own roughly 22 percent of Univision's voting stock and the right to name an unspecified number of directors on the broadcaster's board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now Univision's owners are now betting that they can collect a bigger payout -- around $20 billion or so -- by taking the network public in an I.P.O. instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The company has enjoyed moderate revenue growth over the past three years, according to the prospectus. It reported $2.9 billion in sales last year, up 11 percent from 2013. But its net income tumbled to $900,000 from $216 million in 2013, largely arising from a noncash accounting charge tied to a write-down of programming assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Using a nonstandard financial measure known as operating income before depreciation and amortization, which strips out stock-based compensation and other noncash charges, the network's income rose 13 percent, to $1.2 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not many other details of the stock sale -- like when it would be held, how many shares Univision planned to sell or which exchange would host its ticker symbol -- were disclosed in Thursday's document. (The company listed a preliminary $100 million fund-raising target to determine listing fees.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Univision's prospectus also shed light on some of the company's other endeavors. Among the most prominent of late is the digital- and cable-TV network Fusion, an English-language joint venture with the Walt Disney Company into which both media companies have poured millions of dollars and stocked with name-brand journalists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meant in large part to tap into the same digital-media vein that Vice and BuzzFeed have successfully mined, Fusion has started off slowly. The I.P.O. document disclosed that Fusion's losses widened last year to $35 million, even as its sales jumped ninefold, to $28.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The company also disclosed financials for El Rey, the English-language channel led by the filmmaker Robert Rodriguez. The venture reported a $64.4 million loss last year atop $45 million in revenue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. --  The 220th-ranked player in the world arrived here on his private jet, refreshed after a vacation on his yacht in a luxury resort community in the Bahamas. That player, Tiger Woods, the 14-time major winner and former world No. 1 whose career earnings total over $109 million, returned to work the other day at the Greenbrier Classic at the Greenbrier Resort, an opulent oasis in the middle of West Virginia hill country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Jim Herman, the 224th-ranked player, the tournament was a working vacation. Herman took his wife, their two young children, his mother, his brother and his in-laws to stay with him and rented a three-bedroom cottage on the grounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even at the discounted rate offered to players, the resort, replete with $4 doughnuts, $43 pan-seared chicken breasts and $195 personal meditative sessions, was a little rich for Herman, whose career earnings since he turned professional in 2000 are $1.9 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To enjoy such amenities on a weekly basis on the PGA Tour, Herman said, ''you'd have to be finishing in the top 10 every week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chasm between Herman's lifestyle as a professional golfer and Woods's is wider than the one carved through West Virginia's limestone mountains by the New River. It is much greater than the four-spot gap between Woods and Herman in the world rankings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Woods traveled here from West Palm Beach, Fla., on his Gulfstream G550 and landed at Greenbrier Valley Airport after a commute of roughly 890 miles that took less than two hours. Herman, who tied for 68th at the Travelers Championship last weekend outside Hartford, traveled here in the family minivan, a Honda Odyssey, with his wife and their 5-year-old daughter and 22-month-old son. He drove roughly 200 miles to Philadelphia on Sunday night and covered the last 400 miles of the journey on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We drive a lot,'' said Herman, a veteran of the minitours. ''We're used to it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Herman, a nonwinner on the Tour, has two top-10 finishes in 20 starts in the wraparound season, his best in four nonconsecutive PGA Tour campaigns. With $905,506 in earnings for the season, he felt he could justify splurging on this week's Fourth of July family junket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You just bite the bullet and pay whatever it costs,'' Herman said, adding, ''It's a little motivation to play well, make sure you make it to the weekend so you can pay for it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At 39, Woods is two years older than Herman, who has bounced around between the PGA Tour and the Web.com circuit. Woods has not had a top-10 finish in 23 months, since his tie for second at the 2013 Barclays Championship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His appearance in this event, which is off the beaten path for most of the world's best players (only four of the top 20 were in this year's field), is a byproduct of his struggles. He needs tournament starts to improve his world ranking, which has plunged so low that he is ineligible for World Golf Championships events, like next month's Bridgestone Invitational, which he has won eight times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before his second round on Friday, Woods, the owner of 79 PGA Tour titles, was introduced as ''a man who has dominated every phase of golf he has ever competed in.'' After the round, he was tied for 26th at 135, four strokes behind the leaders, Jhonattan Vegas and Scott Langley. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On May 11, 2014, Woods woke up as the world No. 1. Herman was ranked 385th and operating on the Tour's fringes. Injuries and another swing change have contributed to Woods's nightmarish reversal of fortunes. A happy life away from the golf course, a burgeoning self-belief and a new putter have been key to Herman's progress. Herman raves about his Bettinardi putter and the support, financial and otherwise, of Donald Trump, whom he met while working as an assistant pro at Trump Bedminster, a golf club in New Jersey. Herman wears a Trump patch on his chest and one on his golf bag. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'll always be thankful for the support he showed me at that time and to this day,'' Herman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking after his first-round 67, Herman was wearing a TaylorMade cap and a purple shirt, which was unadorned except for the Trump patch. Poking at his sleeves, he joked, ''I've got a lot of space available.'' After a 72 on Friday, Herman had a lot of extra time; he missed the cut by one stroke. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As usual, Woods was dressed from head to toe in Nike apparel. He has been a brand ambassador for Nike since signing his first deal with the company, for five years and a reported $40 million, in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For as long as Blayne Barber can remember, Woods has been the king of golf. Barber, a 25-year-old PGA Tour rookie, was 6 when Woods turned pro. At the start of the year, Barber hoped to be in the field for this event, but as he explained, ''Being a rookie, you don't really know what your schedule's going to be.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Barber turned professional in 2012. That year, he also took himself out of the running for a PGA Tour card because he could not say with certainty that his sand wedge had not touched a leaf before a shot during a qualifying round. A few days later, he phoned in the penalty and was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The last week that Woods spent at No. 1, Barber was No. 288. With three top-10 finishes in 20 starts, Barber has moved three places ahead of Woods in the world rankings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's got a lot more tournament victories than I do,'' said Barber, a nonwinner on the Tour who has earned $674,871 in this wraparound season. ''So I don't think it really matters.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Barber has not cashed a paycheck since the end of April, when he finished tied for eighth at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. To save on expenses, Barber could have stayed off-site this week. He opted to pay extra in the hope that the convenience and comfort would pay off in a lower score.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Lots of weeks I pay more than I would pay if I was staying somewhere on my own,'' he said, adding, ''You do it because you just try to be as comfortable as you can because if you're comfortable, you'll play well.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With rounds of 70 and 69 on the Old White T.P.C. Course, Barber missed his fifth consecutive cut by a stroke. Every week that he fails to make a dime, he loses at least a couple of thousand dollars in expenses. This weekend, that included a one-way flight from Hartford to Roanoke, Va., through Washington, five nights' lodging and the stipend owed to his caddie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No private jet was waiting at Greenbrier Valley Airport in Lewisburg to whisk him home to Auburn, Ala. After signing his scorecard, Barber called the airlines to see if he could get from here to there before the first rocket's flare on the Fourth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMHERST, N.H. --  The Independence Day parades across New Hampshire on Saturday turned into parades of presidential candidates, and voters like Stuart Harmon were left shaking their heads at the daunting reality of watching, hearing and judging more than 20 contenders for the White House over the next seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This race feels more like a spectator sport than an election,'' said Mr. Harmon, an independent who shook hands with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and watched a dozen other campaign contingents march through this town of about 11,000. ''Having all these candidates is a real problem, because it'll be hard to hear each of them. I'm interested in Jeb Bush, but it's not easy to pay attention to just one when there are so many.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The likely field of 16 Republican candidates is stirring frustration, particularly among voters who say they feel more overwhelmed, even ambivalent, than ever before about their long-cherished responsibilities in holding the nation's first primary. Some voters said they were already dreading the weeks of political fliers stuffed in their mailboxes, of campaign volunteers at their doors during the day and of television ads and automated phone calls all through the night. Others said they already had candidate fatigue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Maybe I'll just vote for the one who leaves me alone the most,'' said Tim Sullivan, a Republican from Gilford. He compared his party's pack of candidates to ''a clown car where they never stop coming out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For decades, New Hampshire has fought to keep its place at the front of the presidential nominating contests, and party leaders talk with almost religious fervor about the state's duty to ''screen'' and ''weed out'' second-tier wannabes to save most other Americans the trouble. The state's news outlets, political consultants, and hotel and hospitality industries also make tens of millions of dollars from the campaign operations. Politics is pastime here, but the 2016 race creates a challenge that is the opposite of a leisure pursuit: Is there such a thing for New Hampshire voters as too many presidential candidates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I can't keep track of all of them. It's ridiculous,'' Laura Major, an independent voter from Milford, said as she collected candidate stickers and free candy from volunteers for Mr. Bush and other campaigns along the parade route here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steve Sartorelli, a registered independent from Auburn, said he felt that the plethora of long-shot candidates was ''insulting our intelligence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It feels like a lot of Republicans are running for the recognition or to get a TV gig or another job, not because they actually believe they could win the presidency,'' Mr. Sartorelli said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the Democratic side are a mere five candidates, though only two, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, are showing real strength in polls. And those two names were the only ones on the lips of several voters at a campaign stop for Mrs. Clinton on Friday in Hanover, a liberal enclave that is home to Dartmouth College. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As they stood in line for barbecue at Mrs. Clinton's event, Ann Bracken and Sue Donnelly chuckled when they were asked about Lincoln Chafee, a former Rhode Island governor who is also running on the Democratic side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's certainly interesting on the Republican side -- they keep us entertained,'' Ms. Bracken said. She offered a single name: ''Trump.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While recent polls show Donald Trump running second in the Republican field here, many in New Hampshire still do not take him seriously. But interviews with two dozen Republicans suggested concern that Mr. Trump's remarks, personality and billions of dollars would overshadow more credible Republican candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Mr. Trump and some of the others are distractions, and it's frustrating that the serious candidates won't get all the attention,'' said Bill Burtt, a Republican living in Tilton at the New Hampshire Veterans Home, which Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey visited on Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Wolfeboro, a resort town in the northern part of the state, Mr. Christie and his sign-waving supporters were directly ahead of a caravan of volunteers for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Both men zigzagged along the route, urged by paradegoers to come squeeze their hands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I like paying attention, but they have to get their act together, really,'' Lori Kirwan said of the Republicans, shaking her head. ''I don't know,'' she added, her voice trailing off. She and her husband both predicted that candidates would have to drop out well before Primary Day, or it would all become too unwieldy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Senator Jeb Bradley, the Republican majority leader, said the complications of 2016 went beyond the sheer number of candidates: Voters are also struggling because there is no clear front-runner, as there was in 2012 (Mitt Romney), 2008 (John McCain), 2004 (George W. Bush) and 2000 (Mr. McCain).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is the first time since 1996 when we have a wide-open contest, and there are now twice as many major candidates compared to back then,'' Mr. Bradley said. As for his own preferences, they are increasing -- Mr. Bush, Mr. Rubio, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Mr. Christie, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Carly Fiorina, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana -- rather than shrinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But look, by the time our primary rolls around in February, I just can't imagine there will be 16 people on the Republican ballot,'' Mr. Bradley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others are not so sure. The emergence of ''super PACs'' could allow just a few wealthy supporters to finance advertising and other activities for their preferred candidates, giving many of the 2016 contenders the resources to survive poor showings in the first few nominating contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't think Iowa's going to solve anything -- the Republicans will pick up from there and come here,'' said Jack Donovan, an independent from Concord, referring to the presidential caucuses that are held just before the New Hampshire primary. ''The candidates will still have money and more televised debates, and will think: Why not try their luck in New Hampshire?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is the debates that start next month, far more than the number of candidates in the parades this weekend, that many voters are eager to see to help make up their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Every day there are two more Republicans jumping into the race, but hopefully the debates will help us sort all of this out,'' said Okie Howe, a 98-year-old Democrat and Army veteran living at the Tilton retirement home. She said she wanted to find a Republican to support because she was ''sick of Hillary Clinton,'' but thought she would probably vote for Mrs. Clinton in the end because the Republican field ''was too big to make sense out of.'' (As for the 73-year-old Mr. Sanders, Ms. Howe said, ''He's a bit too old, isn't he?'' She then chided herself for ''being the pot calling the kettle black.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other Democrats are torn about not having their own surfeit of candidates this year. Katrina and Todd Spenceman of Chesterfield are a house divided. She is an ardent supporter of Mrs. Clinton, while her husband and many of her friends are Obama 2008 supporters who now lean toward Mr. Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The independent streak in this region is palpable,'' Mr. Spenceman said, attributing some of the buck-the-Clinton behavior to that characteristic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am right on the border of Vermont, which is very Bernie,'' Mrs. Spenceman said. ''I'm experiencing a lot of discord between the former Hillarys abandoning Hillary for Bernie.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Would having more choices, as the Republicans do, benefit the Democratic electorate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes and no,'' Mr. Spenceman said. ''Yes, from a Democratic view, that'd be swell. But I also know that too many choices paralyze people from making a decision.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late June, as much of the nation mourned the killing of nine parishioners in a Charleston, S.C., church, The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, was busy posting articles on a different issue: black crime against white people. ''Adolescent Ape Jailed for Murdering White Man Out of Boredom,'' one headline blared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And after Dylann Roof, a white 21-year-old high school dropout and the apparent author of a vitriolic anti-black diatribe, was arrested and charged with the killings, commenters on another white supremacist site, Stormfront.org, lamented something else: the possibility of the massacre's leading to gun control. ''Jews want the white man's guns. End of story,'' one person wrote from Utah. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the wake of the church massacre, many white supremacist groups have rushed to disavow any link to Mr. Roof and any role in the murders. And while Mr. Roof appears to have been in contact with some white supremacists online, investigators say it does not appear that those people encouraged or assisted in the deadly shootings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the authorities say, Mr. Roof had clearly embraced their worldview. As investigators comb through the data streams of Mr. Roof's electronic equipment, a four-page manifesto apparently written by him before the killings offers a virtual road map to modern-day white supremacy. It contains bitter complaints about black crime and immigration, espousing the virtues of segregation and debating the viability of an all-white enclave in the Pacific Northwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That manifesto has refocused attention on a shadowy movement that, for all its ideological connections to the white racists of the past, is more regionally diverse and sophisticated than its predecessors, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They say it is capable, through its robust online presence, of reaching an audience far wider than the small number of actual members attributed to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's really not a lot out there as far as membership organizations,'' said Don Black, who runs Stormfront.org. ''But there is a huge number, I think more than ever, as far as people actively working in some way to promote our cause. Because they don't have to join an organization now that we have this newfangled Internet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Experts dispute the number of movement supporters but agree about its efforts to modernize. While the virulent racism of old can still be found online, the movement today also includes more button-down websites run by white nationalism think tanks with vanity publishing units. Most of the best-known organizations also claim to have disavowed the violence of groups like the Ku Klux Klan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard B. Spencer, the 37-year-old president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute in Whitefish, Mont., embodies this new generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He holds a master's degree from the University of Chicago and studied for a doctorate in history at Duke University. Now he runs an organization that produces papers on issues like racial differences in intelligence and the crime rate among Hispanic immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''America as it is currently constituted -- and I don't just mean the government; I mean America as constituted spiritually and ideologically -- is the fundamental problem,'' he said in an interview. ''I don't support and agree with much of anything America is doing in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But precisely because the movement is more atomized and has been rendered more anonymous by the Internet, law enforcement officials say it has become harder to track potentially violent lone-wolf terrorists who might draw inspiration from white supremacist sites without being actively involved in the organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''White supremacist lone wolves pose the most significant domestic terrorist threat because of their low profile and autonomy -- separate from any formalized group -- which hampers warning efforts,'' said a Department of Homeland Security report issued in 2009. The report came under fierce criticism from conservatives, who said it unfairly painted them as terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the movement has a leading edge, it is Stormfront.org, an online discussion forum. With about 40,000 visitors a day, it is perhaps the most popular supremacist site in the world based on page views, with more than a million a month (a figure that includes repeat visitors).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Black, its 61-year-old proprietor, straddles the movement's generational divide: a grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama decades ago, he later ushered in the movement's Internet era with Stormfront.org in 1995, and followed up with a two-hour weekday Internet radio show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stormfront's website, operated by Mr. Black out of his home in West Palm Beach, Fla., features the slogan ''White Pride World Wide.'' It is primarily a chat room, with discussion threads that range from innocuous cooking tips to diatribes against gays, immigrants, Jews and blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Black said he had broken from the Klan because it had a history of ''random and senseless violence.'' But he also said he could not rule out violent conflict as white people tried to promote what he called ''our heritage, our values,'' and attempted to realize the dream of a separate all-white enclave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I personally would like to see it play out peacefully,'' he said. ''Unfortunately I took too many history classes, and history is not filled with a lot of peace. America is becoming balkanized just like the Balkans; we are breaking apart because of Hispanics -- particularly in the Southwest -- and other races.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Black was visited last week by F.B.I. agents seeking information about Mr. Roof's online associates, though he said there was no evidence that anybody had encouraged Mr. Roof to commit murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This could obviously become overly broad and become a First Amendment issue,'' Mr. Black said, adding that such inquiries could have a chilling effect on free expression in online posts. He would not comment when asked if he had been served with a subpoena but said lawyers were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A young challenger to Stormfront.org's influence is The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi mixture of message boards and sarcastic commentary begun by 30-year-old Andrew Anglin in 2013. He started it amid a national uproar over the killing in Florida of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old black youth, by a neighborhood watch monitor, George Zimmerman. Mr. Anglin was born in 1984. Like Mr. Black, he has a podcast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Daily Stormer offers frequently updated content, much of it provocatively raw and written by Mr. Anglin, who declined to be interviewed for this article but is believed to run the site out of suburban Columbus, Ohio. In a post on Friday headlined ''Spineless Jewpublicans Respond to the Donald,'' Mr. Anglin took to task virtually the entire Republican presidential field for criticizing Donald&nbsp;Trump's statements on Mexican immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several organizations -- the National Policy Institute, American Renaissance, the Charles Martel Society and its website The Occidental Observer -- try to take a more highbrow approach, couching white nationalist arguments as academic commentary on black inferiority, the immigration threat to whites and other racial issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are also two prominent groups with deep ties to the South: the Council of Conservative Citizens, which evolved from the pro-segregationist White Citizens Councils, and the League of the South, a sparsely trafficked site for hard-core secessionists. The manifesto attributed to Mr. Roof cited the council's website as a source of information about black-on-white crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many groups are said to be financially challenged. For instance, Stormfront.org struggles to raise $7,500 a month from about 800 ''sustaining members'' to cover expenses, Mr. Black said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The exceptions are found among the highbrow organizations: The National Policy Institute and the Martel Society were founded and have been aided by William H. Regnery II, heir to a far-right publishing empire who also oversees a brace of anti-immigration lobbying groups. The Pioneer Fund, a 78-year-old nonprofit foundation that has stoked controversy with its interest in eugenics, also has aided the policy institute and American Renaissance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2004, leaders of the movement met in New Orleans, ostensibly to celebrate the release of David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, who had been imprisoned for fraudulent fund-raising. There, eight major organizations signed an agreement intended to define the modern supremacist movement according to three unifying principles: honorable behavior among all signatories, a high tone in public presentations and zero tolerance for violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The degree to which followers of those groups have maintained the nonviolence pledge remains in dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the manifesto attributed to Mr. Roof included a chilling complaint about the movement's disavowal of violence. ''We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the Internet,'' the paper read. ''Well, someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supremacist groups remain divided by rivalries and philosophical disputes. Those differences sometimes obscure a common goal: to re-establish exclusive white control of the United States or, should that prove impossible as many groups now concede, to build an all-white enclave with its own government and an army to defend it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The League of the South seeks a second Southern secession. The Daily Stormer's Mr. Anglin last month proposed building a white city, possibly in a foreign venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Spencer, who runs the National Policy Institute, said in an interview that he fantasized about an Aryan revival in the style of the Roman Empire. Others have proposed a white enclave in the Pacific Northwest, or ''little Europe'' towns across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stormfront's Mr. Black does not just talk about such aspirations: He spent two years in federal prison for an ill-fated attempt in 1981 to seize the Caribbean island of Dominica for conversion into an all-white paradise, financed by brothels and casinos. The authorities stopped him and his group as they were boarding a yacht with plans to stage a Dominica coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where the masses will be found to establish such audacious and widely condemned ventures is not clear, even to their proponents. But Mr. Spencer noted that Karl Marx had founded communism with no adherents and a simple manifesto. Mr. Black said he believed the online supremacist movement was not merely large but growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Anti-Defamation League has identified some 10,000 white supremacists on websites and on social media like Facebook. But many more are said to be more like Mr. Roof, invisible and surfacing online only to make anonymous comments. Stormfront claims 300,000 registered members, although Mr. Black said only a small fraction were active on the site. Some 95 percent of the site's visitors, he said, are anonymous outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the dozen or so main white supremacist websites, daily page views range from fewer than 1,000 to as many as 40,000, although that figure includes repeat page views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An analysis of traffic to several major supremacist websites shows that many attracted spikes in interest late last year, around the time that anger over the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., was touching off protests in cities and towns across the nation. But it remains far from clear whether it translated into a larger following for any of the groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Estimating the size of the white supremacy movement is ''a murky guessing game,'' said Donald P. Green, a Columbia University professor and expert on hate crimes, because many racists are unwilling to declare a belief that mainstream Americans find abhorrent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gauging its impact on the Charleston murders, he said, is even harder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The idea that you could reaffirm someone's ideology and maybe even sharpen or focus it on a particular target is something these sites are capable of doing,'' Mr. Green said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for the church shooting suspect, Mr. Roof, ''We don't know whether that was a marker for his violent predispositions or might be the cause of them,'' Mr. Green said. ''It might be both.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though many features on The Learning Network are on a July hiatus, our Sixth Annual Summer Reading Contest is going strong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since June 12, hundreds of teenagers have answered the question &quot;What interested you most in The Times this week?,&quot; and, if the previous five summers are any indication, thousands more will weigh in before the contest closes at 7 a.m. on Aug. 21. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each week we choose one winner and several runners-up and honorable mentions. Each week we agonize since we receive so much powerful, interesting writing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Week 2, the judges' favorite was the post by  MinGon,  - a reaction to a photo essay called &quot;Illuminating North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As always, thank you for participating, and for sharing with us your heartfelt, intelligent and witty takes on the news of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winner </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shining a Humanistic Light on the People of North Korea, by MinGon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea has endured constant derision ever since Korea bitterly split, but while the nation causes political dilemmas, the world has forgotten the true gravity of its issues. Seeing David Guttenfelder's photographs reminded me of the realness of the tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a South Korean, I recall being introduced to the relationship early in grade school; even with the armistice, the continuation of war was possible at any given moment. Since leaving Korea in the second grade, I had forgotten the weight of the threat. Outside views blur the matter, as satirical movies and Internet memes mocking Kim demonstrate a lighthearted attitude while the isolation further masks the nation's identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the threat lingers in my mind; it is engraved into my identity, and the images revitalized my former attitudes. Guttenfelder's depiction of life away from the propaganda presents a new perspective; while we have become accustomed to its tightly controlled public image, the photos give a behind-the-scenes look at life in North Korea and shine a humanistic light on the people there. To me, they are reminders that regardless of cultural differences, they are normal people just like us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that reason, I believe that we must push for peace with a new demeanor. As Guttenfelder states, &quot;The stories of 25 million lives, unabstracted by politics. They are the mysteries worth revealing.&quot; We can make an impact by taking the first step: reshaping our views of North Korea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BILLY WITZ</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 7</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Rodriguez, baseball's repentant soul and restored slugger, quipped recently that he would walk to Cincinnati if that were the requirement for him to get to the All-Star Game next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an amusing image. Rodriguez would be more likely to arrive via private jet, deplaning to a tinted-windowed sport utility vehicle with a personal driver, than he would be to trudge along on a footpath, carrying a bag of baseball bats over his shoulder as if it were his metaphorical cross to bear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But no matter how endearing the image of a remorseful Rodriguez is these days or how persuasive his bounce-back season has been after he was suspended for all of 2014 for his role in the Biogenesis scandal, it was not enough for him to be selected Monday as a backup designated hitter when the All-Star reserves and pitchers were announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Rodriguez was omitted, other Yankees had cause to celebrate. First baseman Mark Teixeira and reliever Dellin Betances were selected, and outfielder Brett Gardner will be among five American League players whom fans will vote on for the final spot. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Mets will have a lone representative on the National League team, pitcher Jacob deGrom, and their closer, Jeurys Familia, will be on the five-player ballot for the last National League slot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As much as Rodriguez has been a central figure in baseball -- even last season, when he was not around -- he has not often been on the All-Star Game stage in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The last time he played in one was in 2008 at Yankee Stadium, when he exited in the fifth inning, talked to the news media in the sixth, and took off soon after -- all while Derek Jeter stood on the top step of the dugout cheering on his teammates in what turned out to be a 14-inning victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rodriguez's manager, Joe Girardi, selected him as a reserve in 2010 but chose to leave him on the bench. And in 2011, when he was voted in as a starter, Rodriguez missed the game to have arthroscopic knee surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rodriguez's current All-Star candidacy had the endorsement of Girardi, and he has been in the good graces of Major League Baseball since the beginning of the 2015 season. But his best argument for a spot on the All-Star team was his statistics: 16 home runs, 47 runs batted in and an on-base plus slugging percentage of .902, eighth best in the American League at the start of Monday's games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You take him seriously, regardless of his age or anything else,'' said Angels pitcher C. J. Wilson, who faced Rodriguez last week. ''You look at his stats: He's got a bunch of home runs, a bunch of R.B.I.s.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reserves and pitchers were selected by a vote of players, managers and coaches, with the two All-Star managers, Kansas City's Ned Yost and San Francisco's Bruce Bochy, also making a handful of their own selections. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the American League, Prince Fielder of Texas was the backup designated hitter selected by the players (his power numbers are comparable to Rodriguez's, but his batting average of .350 is 66 points higher).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That left Yost to put him on the American League team with one of his own selections, but in an interview with ESPN, Yost said he preferred to add a player with more versatility in the field than Rodriguez could provide. Rodriguez has played just six games in the field this season, and none since May 23. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We spent a lot of time debating his name,'' Yost said of Rodriguez. ''We wanted to get Alex Rodriguez on there and couldn't.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fans do not seem to be overly bothered by players who have been linked to performance-enhancing drugs: St. Louis shortstop Jhonny Peralta and Seattle designated hitter Nelson Cruz, who both served drug suspensions in connection with the Biogenesis case, were voted by fans as 2015 starters, Cruz for the second consecutive season. And Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal, who was also suspended because of his Biogenesis links, was named to the National League team by Bochy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rodriguez, in relying on his peers to vote him into a reserve spot, also had to deal with whatever resentment remained toward him because of his repeated links to performance enhancers and to the fact that he attacked the players' union when he was initially contesting his 2014 suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But at least some players seemed to have moved on from those days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The way the league works is when you serve your suspension, it's over with,'' Tampa Bay pitcher Chris Archer, himself an All-Star, said Sunday when asked how he would feel about Rodriguez representing the American League. ''You serve your 50 or 100 games -- now it's 80 for the first time -- and it's supposed to be over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of Rodriguez, he added, ''If he does get it, he's earned it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, Rodriguez did not. And with the next generation of marquee talent, players like Mike Trout and Bryce Harper, headlining this year's game, Rodriguez might have seemed out of place -- a relic from another era whose athleticism, if not his swing, had disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other players of note who were named as All-Stars on Monday include Albert Pujols of the Los Angeles Angels, who will replace the injured Miguel Cabrera in the American League lineup; four Baltimore Orioles (Manny Machado, Adam Jones, and pitchers Zach Britton and Darren O'Day); Felix Hernandez of Seattle; the rookie Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs; Andrew McCutchen of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who will replace the injured Giancarlo Stanton in the National League lineup; and two pitchers with old New York ties -- A. J. Burnett of the Pirates and Francisco Rodriguez of the Milwaukee Brewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A notable omission was the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, who is 5-6 this season with a 3.08 E.R.A. Kersahw had made the last four N.L. All-Star teams and was the league's Cy Young Award winner in three of the last four seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So if anything, Rodriguez now has some distinguished company on the sidelines. And on Monday he was surrounded by adoring fans at a charity golf event in the Bronx run by Hank Steinbrenner, a co-chairman of the Yankees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rodriguez signed autographs for teenage baseball players, ate dinner with his daughter and received kudos from an unlikely, and currently embattled, source: Donald Trump, whose golf course served as the site of the fund-raiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A-Rod, keep playing well,'' said Trump, who two years ago wrote on Twitter that Rodriguez was an embarrassment to New Yorkers. ''You're doing a hell of a job.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of a Mexican laborer with a lengthy criminal record who was charged on Tuesday in the fatal shooting of an American woman on a pier in San Francisco has exposed a gulf of mistrust and failed communication between the federal authorities and the police in California over immigration enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, most recently known as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, 56, pleaded not guilty in Superior Court in San Francisco in the murder of Kathryn Steinle, 32, who was strolling last Wednesday with her father and a friend on Pier 14 near the Ferry Building when she was struck in what the police described as a random shooting. Mr. Lopez-Sanchez, whose criminal record includes seven felony convictions, had been deported from the United States five times, raising questions about why he was in the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Questions were also raised late Tuesday about the gun used in the killing. A law enforcement official confirmed local media reports that the serial number showed the gun belonged to a federal agent. The official declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case immediately became fodder in the polarized debate over immigration. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, who has been under fire for comments about Mexican immigrants, pointed to the killing as ''yet another example of why we must secure our border immediately.'' On Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic presidential contender, said San Francisco had ''made a mistake.'' And Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, also a Democrat, called on the city to restore its cooperation with the Obama administration in enforcing immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lapse in the case of Mr. Lopez-Sanchez -- also known as Jos&eacute; Inez Garc&iacute;a Zarate and several other names -- did not occur at the border, legal records show. After being deported in June 2009, he tried to return three months later but was stopped by agents at the crossing in Eagle Pass, Tex. He was then prosecuted for a felony of illegal entry and served almost four years in a federal prison in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When he finished his sentence, the prison sent him to San Francisco on March 27, based on a warrant for a 20-year-old felony marijuana charge. Within a day, a local court dismissed the charges. Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi of San Francisco said Mr. Lopez-Sanchez stayed in jail for three weeks so the authorities could verify that he was eligible for release. He was freed April 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At that point, communications between San Francisco and federal authorities broke down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal officials say that as soon as they learned of Mr. Lopez-Sanchez's transfer from federal prison to San Francisco, they issued a request to Sheriff Mirkarimi to notify them when he would be released. An order for his deportation was ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are just asking for a heads-up, a phone call,'' said Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE. ''We did not hear anything until the day this young woman was killed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A San Francisco ordinance, passed in 2013, broadly restricts the police from cooperating with immigration agents. City officials say the so-called sanctuary law has helped law enforcement by enhancing trust between the police and residents who are immigrants without documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sheriff Mirkarimi said the city's ordinance allowed him to respond to the federal authorities only when he had a court order or warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They had his rap sheet and they were well aware of our policies,'' the sheriff said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ''The natural question is, why wouldn't they follow through with a warrant for this suspect?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said Ms. Steinle's killing was ''a horrible and senseless act that requires ICE to really work with local governments in a way that comports with local law.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has long struggled to shape an enforcement strategy to deport convicted criminals like Mr. Lopez-Sanchez but avoid the deportation of undocumented immigrants arrested by the police for low-level offenses. In November, President Obama said he would abandon a nationwide program known as Secure Communities, which connected federal agents with local police. Officials announced a new, less aggressive program, but they have been slow to explain it to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All but a few California counties have adopted laws restricting cooperation with federal agents, and the state enacted a law in 2014 -- although it would not have applied to Mr. Lopez-Sanchez because of his criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a halting, often incoherent interview from the jailhouse on Monday with KGO-TV in San Francisco, Mr. Lopez-Sanchez said that he had found a gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a bench on the pier, and that when he picked it up, it had fired three shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking in Spanish, he said he did not remember the events well because he had taken sleeping pills. But he said, ''When I go to the court, I am going to plead guilty,'' and added, ''I want to have the punishment I deserve as quickly as possible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Steinle was ''the most amazing, loving, outgoing person,'' her brother Brad Steinle told Anderson Cooper on CNN. He cautioned against rancor over the killing. It would be ''easy for us to hate and be angry, but Kate wouldn't want that,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Hillary Rodham Clinton used the first major news interview of her presidential campaign to directly attack the Republican candidate Jeb Bush for supporting an immigration policy that would not provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million to 12 million immigrants living illegally in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He doesn't believe in a path to citizenship,'' Mrs. Clinton told CNN after a campaign event here Tuesday. ''If he did at one time, he no longer does.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also criticized the rest of the Republican 2016 field for not rejecting more stridently recent comments by Donald J. Trump calling illegal Mexican immigrants ''rapists'' and criminals. The comments prompted many businesses to end partnerships with Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party,'' Mrs. Clinton said, adding of the rest of the Republican candidates, ''But they are all in the, you know, in the same general area on immigration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's comments to CNN emphasize how important the issue of immigration and winning over Latino votes will be in the 2016 election. She has already said she would seek to go further than President Obama in expanding a path to citizenship to students here illegally and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Saturday, Mr. Bush, whose wife is Mexican, said he took offense to Mr. Trump's comments. ''To make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokeswoman, Emily Benavides, said Mr. Bush believed in ''legal status for those currently in the country after they pay fines and taxes, learn English and commit no substantial crimes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jorge Guerra, a 26-year-old of Guatemalan decent, waited outside a public library here to see Mrs. Clinton at her town-hall-style event. He said he wanted to hear what she had to say about Latin America and immigration. But he said he also wanted to hear from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a socialist independent who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, before deciding whom to support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guerra said that part of what was holding him back from being all-in for Mrs. Clinton was her relationship to Wall Street and corporations. ''It unnerves me,'' he said. ''I want her to be as honest about and be as open as possible about a lot of these questions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton tried to answer some of them by sitting down with CNN. The questions ranged from her use of a personal email address while at the State Department to recent polls that show a growing number of voters do not trust her. ''That has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for many, many years,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''At the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before the interview, Mrs. Clinton reassured the crowd of roughly 350 people who packed into the library that she could be trusted to look out for average Americans. ''I want people's lives to be better when I finish as your president than when I started,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The event was the start of a second phase in Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign in which she intends to speak to larger crowds and take more questions from voters in the early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This liberal college town, which is home to the University of Iowa and overwhelmingly favored Mr. Obama and John Edwards in 2008 (she came in third statewide), could serve as a test of whether Mrs. Clinton's message resonates with the Democratic Party's base. Mr. Sanders drew a crowd of 300 people at an event here in May. (Mrs. Clinton's campaign said an additional 250 people had waited outside her event at the library.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In her remarks, an animated Mrs. Clinton seemed to try to hit all the liberal notes, including combating climate change, giving women access to reproductive health care, and celebrating the Supreme Court's recent decisions affirming the right to same-sex marriage nationwide and upholding a crucial provision of Mr. Obama's health care overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If a Republican is elected president, that will be the end of the Affordable Care Act,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Iowa City, she headed to Ottumwa to talk to supporters at a house party. The campaign said it had directly reached 16,000 Iowans so far and recruited at least one committed caucusgoer in each of the state's 1,682 precincts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mrs. Clinton still has much to do in this state, where voters expect to personally meet their candidates before participating in the caucuses, which will take place Feb. 1. Her advantage over Mr. Sanders narrowed in a recent Quinnipiac University poll -- she still led by double digits -- and Iowans are clearly checking their options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think I'm here out of curiosity more than anything else,'' said Ashley Heffernen, 22, a recent college graduate who waited in line with her boyfriend to hear Mrs. Clinton in Iowa City and hoping to ask a question about immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton seemed acutely aware of how tough things may be for her in Iowa. After her remarks, she took questions from the audience. Dozens of hands went up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm going to let you pick,'' she told the crowd. ''Because I don't want to lose any potential caucusgoers.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- With San Francisco's immigration policies drawing criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike, Mayor Edwin M. Lee said Wednesday that he would speak to federal officials about how the city could participate in a new Obama administration deportation program, after a Mexican felon who had been deported five times was charged with murdering a 32-year-old woman, Kathryn Steinle, as she walked on a tourist pier in the city last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's comments, on KQED Radio, came after he braved a week of outrage over the city's longstanding sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, which have curtailed most cooperation between the local police and federal immigration agents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lee ''has asked his staff to begin researching how we could participate in the program while still upholding the laws and values of our sanctuary policy,'' Christine Falvey, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said in a telephone interview. ''He thinks we absolutely should look into this program if we can participate and still protect all of our residents.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  San Francisco's decision to let the Mexican felon, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, out of jail without alerting the federal authorities has been castigated by Republicans like Donald J. Trump and questioned by Democrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton and California's two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein. Jeb Bush, at a Republican campaign event in New Hampshire on Wednesday, said that sanctuary cities should be eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Feinstein wrote a letter to Mr. Lee urging him to cooperate with officials from the Department of Homeland Security and its Immigrations and Customs Enforcement arm, to participate in a new federal program that focuses on criminal convicts and asks the police to notify federal agents when those immigrants will be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The tragic death of Ms. Steinle could have been avoided,'' Ms. Feinstein said in a statement. ''I strongly believe that an undocumented individual, convicted of multiple felonies and with a detainer request from I.C.E., should not have been released. We should focus on deporting convicted criminals, not setting them loose on our streets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I agree,'' Mr. Lee said in a radio interview on Wednesday, responding to Ms. Feinstein. He said he would speak with senior Homeland Security officials this week to explore how the city could participate in the new federal deportation program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also on Wednesday, officials said that the gun they say that Mr. Lopez-Sanchez used came from a federal Bureau of Land Management law enforcement agent. It was stolen from the ranger's vehicle in June while he was in San Francisco on official business, a spokesman for the agency said. The theft was immediately reported to the San Francisco police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The weapon, a .40-caliber handgun, was found in San Francisco Bay by police divers soon after Ms. Steinle was shot and killed while she was walking along Pier 14, a popular tourist attraction, with her father and a friend. Mr. Lopez-Sanchez, 56, pleaded not guilty in court on Tuesday and is being held on $5 million bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police used the serial number on the gun to track it to the federal agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  San Francisco is a so-called sanctuary city, where undocumented immigrants without criminal records are generally protected from federal deportation agents. But ''the sanctuary city ordinance was never designed to harbor repeat serious offenders,'' Mr. Lee said on KQED. ''If there is a gap, let's close that gap.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lee, who often points out that his parents were Chinese immigrants, has faced a week of outraged questions, including from many residents, over the city's sanctuary policies. He placed some blame for the mishandling of Mr. Lopez-Sanchez on the county sheriff, Ross Mirkarimi, who released him on April 15 without notifying federal agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think a simple phone call would have done the trick,'' Mr. Lee said. ''I think the sheriff dropped the ball there.'' He said more direct communication with federal agents might be needed. If San Francisco joined the Homeland Security program, it would be a reversal of the city's longstanding reluctance to cooperate with the federal immigration authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of the undocumented immigrants living in the United States, roughly one quarter are in California, more than any other state in the country. Immigrants account for roughly 30 percent of the state population, and Latinos now outnumber whites as the state's largest ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  California legislators have passed several laws designed to integrate undocumented immigrants living in the state, including a law that is meant to protect undocumented immigrants without a criminal history from deportations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gov. Jerry Brown, who initially vetoed the legislation and later signed an amended version, has so far not spoken out about the shooting. In a statement, his spokesman, Evan Westrup, said that ''California law vests authority for cases of this kind within the sound discretion of local authority,'' adding, ''A tragedy such as this warrants a careful review of what happened, how the applicable rules were interpreted and what changes might be called for.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, Ms. Boxer, who has announced her retirement, called for a review of the state's detention policies in the wake of Ms. Steinle's murder. ''For decades, I have supported deporting violent criminals, and I have always believed that sanctuary should not be given to felons,'' Ms. Boxer said. ''I have reached out to Governor Brown to ask whether state law was followed in this case, and if so, whether the law needs to be strengthened to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, Ms. Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate, said that San Francisco officials had ''made a mistake,'' adding in an interview on CNN that she had ''absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And earlier this week, Mr. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, seized on the Lopez-Sanchez case as proof of his assertion that scores of immigrants coming from Mexico are ''criminals, drug dealers, rapists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While many public officials in the state have emphasized that they support deportation of criminals, there has been no call for a wholesale revamping of the state's policies. Instead, the State Senate plans to vote on a resolution Thursday condemning Mr. Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're not going to allow the scapegoating or have the deplorable actions by one deranged individual stop our effort to include the millions of hard-working immigrants who call California home,'' said Ricardo Lara, a state senator from Los Angeles and a former chairman of the Legislature's Latino caucus. ''These are two very different things, and we're not going to let this deter years of progress we have made here.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The presidential race, slow-forming for much of the year, sprang clearly to life this week. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good Friday morning from Washington, where Congress took up the debate over the Confederate battle flag and where former President Jimmy Carter can still draw a crowd in the rain. While the summer election cycle has seemed to be mostly about adding a new candidate every few days, this week offered a look at some story lines that are bound to endure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential race, slow-forming for much of the year, sprang clearly to life this week with disparate events that could play a role in deciding the Republican nominee and the contours of the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one sphere is Donald J. Trump, the bombastic real estate developer and television personality. Skepticism remains about whether he'll stay in the presidential race through the fall, but he appears to be laser-focused on making it into the primary debates next month. And he is dominating the discussion in the Republican Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slow reaction from party figures to his caustic remarks about Mexicans has again highlighted divisions over an immigration overhaul, two years after Republicans criticized Mitt Romney's tone on the issue in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trump's remarks are already being used by Hillary Rodham Clinton to tar the Republican field, including Jeb Bush, the one party candidate who has long made overhauling immigration a cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Mrs. Clinton and her allies have pounced on a comment from Mr. Bush about people needing to &quot;work longer hours&quot; to improve the economy. The Clinton team has said the comment defines him as a clone of Mr. Romney, who was lampooned as out of touch by President Obama in the 2012 race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush is certain to hear about that statement for weeks, but Mrs. Clinton's campaign is signaling clearly that they see him as the likeliest nominee. And he will be able to make that point to Republicans to try to galvanize support in a crowded field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the economic turbulence in Greece and in Puerto Rico is a familiar pocket of uncertainty as the United States recovers from the Great Recession and moves toward a national election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Maggie Haberman </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Watching Today </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Right to Life Convention will hold a presidential candidate forum, attended by Ben Carson, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, whose parents owned a bar and pool hall when he was a child, and who announced his candidacy near where it used to be, will be in New Hampshire for several events, including a Politics and Pool gathering at Milly's Tavern in Manchester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere on the trail, Carly Fiorina, a Republican, and Lincoln Chafee, running as a Democrat, will also be in New Hampshire. And there are no scheduled appearances in Iowa, which was thick with candidates in the weeks before July 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Confederate Flag Battle Spills Into Congress </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats took full advantage of an opportunity to pummel House Republicans over the Confederate flag on Thursday as Southern Republicans pushed to reverse a series of proposed limits on the banner or kill a spending bill that contained them. Encouraged by lawmakers from the South, Democrats forced a series of votes that prompted an uproar on the floor as they accused the Republican majority of having more allegiance to the Confederate flag than the South Carolina legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the flag issue also illustrated a fundamental divide for congressional Republicans. Party members from the Northeast and the Midwest, for decades the backbone of the Grand Old Party, have no tradition of revering a flag that their states led the charge against in the Civil War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, a state central to the antislavery movement and the Union war effort, answered quickly and unequivocally when pressed on whether he thought Confederate flags were appropriate in federal cemeteries, the specific issue before the House: &quot;No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Republicans from states that were at the forefront of the Union ranks and that hold their Civil War legacy dear were no doubt wondering how their party got itself into such a fix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Southern states, which now hold sway in the Republican Party in the House, were long represented mainly by conservative Democrats. They had little regard for the Republican Party until the Democratic embrace of the civil rights movement upended the political dynamic of the South. It began a shift to the Republican side that became a surge in the late 1980s and early 1990s, putting House delegations from the South firmly in Republican hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jimmy Carter, Releasing His Latest Book, Will 'Outlive All of Us' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Carter may have a future in politics. Hundreds lined up around the block in drenching rain to catch a glimpse of the former president as he signed copies of his latest book - his 29th - &quot;A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety&quot; at a Washington bookstore on Thursday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Carter, who took office in 1977 and served one term, held court as former officials from his administration, journalists and a star-struck group of young and old, white and black came to say hello and post pictures on Instagram. Mr. Carter signed every last book. &quot;Why not? He's only 90,&quot; said Gerald Rafshoon, Mr. Carter's White House communications director. &quot;He'll outlive all of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arthur Sackley, a fellow 1950s veteran of the Navy, proudly brought his 1976 Carter-Mondale campaign button to show him. &quot;He's a good man, but he had some bad luck and it obscured what he did,&quot; Mr. Sackley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone doubting the 90-year-old's acumen, however, was quickly disabused of the idea. When the former New York Times correspondent James Wooten - the author of a 1978 Carter biography that upset the White House - came to get his book signed, Mr. Carter smiled mischievously and told him: &quot;I mentioned you in my book.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Favorites From Today's Times </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the announcement from Mr. Bush and his allies on Thursday that they had raised more than $114 million in campaign funds over the last six months, he has raced past his rivals in the money game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Office of Personnel Management said that hackers had stolen the data of 21.5 million people, an episode it said was separate from but related to a previous breach that compromised the data of 4.2 million federal employees. Though the Senate urgently took up a cybersecurity bill a few weeks ago, it failed, and it is not a part of the Senate's busy post-break lineup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And both Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mrs. Clinton have laid out lofty policy proposals that would require high levels of new spending in areas including child care and job growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We're Reading Elsewhere </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Trump has been critical of Mrs. Clinton as they race toward the same goal, but in 2008, BuzzFeed reminds us, he offered her high praise, calling her &quot;a terrific woman&quot; and a &quot;friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sanders has a long record on the issues, but, Politico Magazine writes, less is known about &quot;the hungry early years that made him the surging socialist he is today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Vox delves into Mr. Bush's claim that &quot;people need to work longer hours&quot; and whether it was indeed a gaffe, as Democrats say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Democrat's Plea on the House Floor: 'Say No to Oreos' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add another name to the list of those vilified on the floor of the House of Representatives: the Oreo cookie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, denounced Mondelez, the makers of the chocolate cookie and its cream filling, on Thursday for closing a plant in his home district and laying off 300 workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The company that makes Oreo cookies and Ritz Crackers, two very well-known American brands, decided that for the first time in 60 years they would close their legendary Philadelphia plant in the heart of my district,&quot; he said, while standing next to a &quot;Say No to Oreo&quot; placard that featured two cookies with a red line across them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sign drew some attention on social media, as even former Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York chimed in: &quot;Jeez, I leave town, and it's open season on Oreos?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mr. Boyle, the issue was as plain as black and white, as he concluded: &quot;Mr. Speaker, it's not right. Say no to Oreo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, with meager poll numbers so far, plans to spend 19 of the next 33 days in Iowa wooing potential caucusgoers. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His poll numbers have been meager and he might not qualify for the early debates, but former Senator Rick Santorum is clinging to his slow-and-steady-wins-the-race mantra with one thing on his mind: Iowa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum, a conservative Republican from Pennsylvania who gave a tough challenge to Mitt Romney the last time around, said on Monday that he plans to spend 19 of the next 33 days in Iowa wooing potential caucusgoers. A strong showing in the caucuses, he hopes, will jump-start a campaign that so far faces long odds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is how much money you need to win Iowa and be competitive after that,&quot; Mr. Santorum, who won the caucuses there in 2012, said at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor. &quot;In my opinion, it's not nearly the number that's being talked about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His victory in Iowa ignited Mr. Santorum's campaign and fund-raising in 2012, and he competed with Mr. Romney through April of that year by appealing to working-class Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum has so far failed to gain much traction in Iowa, but he is betting that will change as he grinds out more events and meets more voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In spite of all the new models, I think this model is a pretty good, reliable model that people are going to come back to and say that all that glitters is not gold,&quot; Mr. Santorum said of himself, pointing out that even someone such as Donald J. Trump might not actually be as conservative as he sounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An effective debater, Mr. Santorum bemoaned Republican leaders who have sought to limit participation in the debates to candidates who are leading in the polls. However, he plans to avoid being overly provocative or spend money on advertising in an effort to meet a certain polling threshold. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, it will be all about Iowa for Mr. Santorum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think Iowa has changed,&quot; Mr. Santorum said. &quot;In the end, Iowa is going to cut this field down dramatically. Much more than if you attend a debate or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Asked while campaigning in New Hampshire if he considered himself an independent or a conservative, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin paused, then said, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m an American, that&amp;#8217;s what I am.&amp;#8221; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMHERST, N.H. - Is Scott Walker too conservative to win the New Hampshire primary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker, the Wisconsin governor who has been increasingly running to the right to help himself in the Iowa caucuses, faced that question from a reporter as he arrived at his first campaign event in New Hampshire on Thursday. Well aware that independent voters can cast ballots in the Republican primary in this state, and could be a decisive force, Mr. Walker put some distance between himself and the conservative label.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This state is an independent state, I'm an independent guy,&quot; Mr. Walker said outside Joey's Diner in Amherst. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to his fights in Wisconsin against labor unions, among others, he added: &quot;I took the power out of the hands of the big government special interest and put it firmly in the hands of the American people. I don't think the people of New Hampshire want to be told who they should vote for - they want to hear who the right person is to lead this country forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he considered himself an independent or a conservative, Mr. Walker paused for a couple of seconds, then said, &quot;I'm an American, that's what I am. I'm an American. I'm going to continue to stand for American values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker has been focused more on wooing the conservative and evangelical Republican electorate in Iowa, which he considers a must win for his candidacy, than voters in New Hampshire, where he hasn't campaigned since May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of his Republican rivals, including former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Donald J. Trump, have been spending more time in New Hampshire lately.</SPAN></P>
